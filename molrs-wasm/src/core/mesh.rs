//! WASM binding for the triangle mesh ([`Mesh`]).
//!
//! A surface, not a structure: shared vertices plus indexed faces, with no
//! atoms and no simulation box. It is what [`readSTL`](crate::io::mesh) hands
//! back — the container a packing run was confined to, the geometry a viewer
//! paints around the trajectory.
//!
//! Accessors copy into fresh typed arrays rather than viewing WASM memory, so
//! the caller may keep them after `free()`. Coordinates come back as
//! `Float32Array`: a mesh goes to a GPU vertex buffer, which is `f32`
//! regardless, and the double it was read as buys nothing on the way there.
