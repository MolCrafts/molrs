//! Neighbor search — the WASM face of `molrs::core::NeighborList`.
//!
//! Two doors, one per question:
//!
//! - [`NeighborList`] — a **self** search over one point set. `build` /
//!   `update` index the coordinates and enumerate nothing; `neighbors()`
//!   materializes the half-shell pairs (`i < j`) into a [`Neighbors`] table.
//! - [`NeighborQuery`] — a **cross** search: index a reference frame once, then
//!   ask which of its atoms lie within the cutoff of another frame's atoms.
//!
//! Both produce the same [`Neighbors`] column table, which the analysis classes
//! (`RDF`, `Cluster`, the order parameters, …) and `LBFGS` consume.
//!
//! All distances are in angstrom (Å).

/// Neighbor search over one point set: index the coordinates, then read pairs.

/// `update` place the atoms in space and enumerate **nothing**, while
/// `neighbors()` materializes the pairs into a [`Neighbors`] table.
