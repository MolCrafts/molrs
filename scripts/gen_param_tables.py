"""Translate the antechamber / AMBER / OPLS parameter tables into committed Rust data.

molrs parses NO parameter text at runtime. This script reads the upstream tables
from `$AMBERHOME` and emits typed Rust `const`s into
`molrs/src/ff/params/`. The emitted `.rs` is the single in-repo source
of truth: the raw `.DAT` / `.DEF` files are NOT vendored.

Twelve tables, from two upstream directories:

  dat/antechamber/
    BCCPARM.DAT          -> bccparm.rs        (corrections + CORR aliases)
    BCCPARM_ABCG2.DAT    -> bccparm_abcg2.rs  (corrections + CORR aliases)
    GASPARM.DAT          -> gasparm.rs        (Gasteiger PEOE parameters)
    ATOMTYPE_{BCC,ABCG2,GAS,GFF,GFF2,AMBER,SYBYL}.DEF -> atomtype_*.rs
  dat/leap/parm/
    gaff.dat             -> gaff.rs           (MASS/BOND/ANGLE/DIHE/IMPROPER/NONBON)
    gaff2.dat            -> gaff2.rs          (idem)

All seven `.DEF` files share ONE ATD / WILDATOM grammar, so there is one parser
here and seven outputs. Both `gaff*.dat` are AMBER's sectioned `parm` format, so
they likewise share one parser (`parse_parm`) and two outputs.

An additional upstream table is READ but not emitted on its own: `PARMCHK.DAT`
supplies the `AtdRule.alternate` column (see `parse_parmchk`). The `.DEF` files
emit only the phase-1 name of a conjugated system (`cc`); antechamber renames one
colour of each conjugated system to a partner (`cd`) that no `.DEF` row declares,
and `PARMCHK.DAT` is where that pairing is written down.

The environment (`f9`) and atom-property (`f8`) mini-languages are PRE-PARSED
into a static AST — that is the whole point: molrs walks the AST, it never
re-parses a string. Pattern atom names are resolved here too (`EW` / WILDATOM /
element symbol -> `PatternAtom`), so an unknown name is a generator error rather
than a rule that silently never matches.

One further table has an in-repo source rather than an AmberTools one:

  molrs/data/oplsaa.xml   -> oplsaa.rs   (OPLS-AA, converted to molrs units)

That XML is RETIRED — `chem-perceive-14` compiled it into `oplsaa.rs` and deleted
it, because two copies of the same numbers is one copy too many and only one of
them was ever checked. So the emitter runs only when the source is present (a
maintainer who restores it from `git show <rev>:molrs/data/oplsaa.xml` gets a
byte-for-byte re-emission); otherwise the committed table stands and is hashed
into the manifest exactly as if it had just been written. The XML's SHA-256 is
recorded here (`RETIRED_XML_SOURCES`) and in MANIFEST.sha256 — that row is now
the only surviving record of which bytes those numbers came from.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# gaff.dat / gaff2.dat — AMBER's `parm` format (one parser, two outputs)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The `parm` format is POSITIONAL, not labelled: no section carries a heading,
# and each is terminated by a blank line. Reading it therefore means walking the
# sections in the order the format fixes them (LEaP's own reader does the same):
#
#     title
#     MASS        rows      -> emitted
#     hydrophilic list      (one line, no blank terminator)   -> not emitted
#     BOND        rows      -> emitted
#     ANGLE       rows      -> emitted
#     DIHE        rows      -> emitted
#     IMPROPER    rows      -> emitted
#     10-12 H-bond rows     -> not emitted
#     equivalence rows      -> not emitted (and guarded: see `parse_parm`)
#     `MOD4  RE` label      (declares the units of the NONBON columns)
#     NONBON      rows      -> emitted
#     END
#
# Three sections carry no force-field parameter and are not emitted. That is not
# a silent drop — each is accounted for:
#
# * the **hydrophilic list** is a solvation hint for LEaP's `solvateBox`, not a
#   parameter, and antechamber ignores it too;
# * the **10-12 H-bond** section is the pre-ff94 hydrogen-bond potential, dead
#   since 1994; both files carry exactly one row there, the `hw`/`ow` fast-water
#   flag, and `parse_parm` errors if that ever changes rather than guessing at
#   the column meanings of a format nothing documents any more;
# * the **equivalence** section would make one atom type borrow another's NONBON
#   row. It is empty in both files, and `parse_parm` errors if it stops being —
#   a non-empty one silently changes what a NONBON lookup means.
#
# The atom-type columns are FIXED-WIDTH (`A2,1X,A2,...`), which is load-bearing:
# a wildcard row reads `X -c -c -X `, and splitting that on whitespace yields
# `['X', '-c', '-c', '-X']` — four wrong types. They are cut by column instead.

#: The `X` atom type of a DIHE / IMPROPER row: matches any type. Emitted as
#: `None`, so a consumer cannot read a wildcard slot as a concrete type by
#: accident. gaff.dat and gaff2.dat carry 615 wildcard rows each and spec 11's
#: parmchk2-style fallback matching is built on them.
