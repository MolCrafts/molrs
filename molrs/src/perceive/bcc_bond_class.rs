//! BCC bond-type perception — the bond typing AM1-BCC is keyed on.
//!
//! AM1-BCC does not correct charges per *bond order*; it corrects them per **BCC
//! bond type**, a richer alphabet that distinguishes an aromatic single bond from
//! an aliphatic one and, crucially, marks *delocalized* bonds (a carboxylate's two
//! C–O bonds are neither "single" nor "double" — they are the same bond). Both the
//! `ATOMTYPE_BCC.DEF` atom-type rules (which count `sb`/`db`/`ab`/`DL` bonds) and
//! the `BCCPARM.DAT` correction table are keyed on it, so getting it wrong
//! silently corrupts every downstream charge.
//!
//! # The alphabet
//!
//! | Type | Meaning | Produced by |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | 1 | single | bond order 1 |
//! | 2 | double | bond order 2 |
//! | 3 | triple | bond order 3 |
//! | 6 | N–O/S on a **non-delocalized** N carrying a second terminal chalcogen (nitrite) | part 3 |
//! | 7 | aromatic single | part 1 — aromatic promotion |
//! | 8 | aromatic double | part 1 — aromatic promotion |
//! | 9 | delocalized (carboxylate, nitro, sulfonate, phosphate) | parts 2, 4 and 5 |
//!
//! The part numbering is antechamber's own (`bondtype.c::finalize()`), kept so the
//! rules here can be read against the source they came from.
//!
//! # Two entry points: the input's orders, or antechamber's
//!
//! * `assign_bcc_bond_types_from_connectivity` is `bondtype -j full`, what
//!   antechamber runs by default (`-j 4`, and always for `-c bcc`): the bond
//!   orders are judged from the connectivity alone ([`perceive_bond_orders`]),
//!   the input's ignored; aromatic rings for part 1 are antechamber's own
//!   ring classes ([`perceive_ring_classes`]) of the input's bond types; and part 3 is
//!   written as `bondtype` writes it.
//!   On the file antechamber reads, the bond types are antechamber's, bond
//!   for bond — including the Kekulé structure of a molecule that has two
//!   (azulene, cyclooctatetraene), which the order of the atoms and bonds
//!   decides, as it does for antechamber.
//! * `assign_bcc_bond_types` keeps the input's orders: a localized bond is typed
//!   by the number it states, an aromatic one by the Kekulé structure molrs
//!   derives for it (below), promoted on molrs's own aromaticity, with part 3
//!   repaired (below). Its answer does not depend on the order of the bonds.
//!
//! The alphabet both emit is `{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}`. Two further values exist
//! in the tables:
//!
//! * **10** is not a peer of 7/8 — it is the *unresolved* aromatic precursor (the
//!   SYBYL `ar` input token). `assign_bcc_bond_types` resolves it into 7 or 8;
//!   `assign_bcc_bond_types_from_connectivity` keeps it only where antechamber
//!   does: an `ar` bond of a molecule no valence state closes.
//! * **11** occupies 26 same-type diagonal rows of `BCCPARM.DAT`, all with a
//!   correction of exactly `0.0000`, and no rule reaches it.
//!
//! # Aromatic promotion is not "is the bond aromatic?"
//!
//! A bond is promoted to 7/8 only when **both** endpoints are aromatic *and* they
//! share a ring of size **5 or 6 in which every ring atom is aromatic**. So
//! biphenyl's inter-ring bond and every bond of a 7-membered aromatic ring stay
//! 1/2 (part 1 of the perception). antechamber's "aromatic" is a ring class
//! (AR1 / AR2) rather than Hückel aromaticity: a quinone ring read from a
//! connectivity-only file is AR1 and promoted; the five-ring of an indole is
//! taken out by the AM1-BCC indole rule and is not.
//!
//! # Kekulé structures, when the input's orders are kept
//!
//! An aromatic input carries no Kekulé structure (order 1.5), so
//! `assign_bcc_bond_types` derives one by minimising the valence-state penalty
//! (`APS.DAT`) over the aromatic subsystem. Which of 7/8 a given ring bond ends
//! up with is *charge-invariant* — `BCCPARM` stores identical corrections for
//! types 7, 8 and 10 — but the **atom types** are not: a heteroaromatic ring
//! with two degenerate Kekulé structures (imidazolium) puts the N–C double bond
//! on a different nitrogen in each, and those two nitrogens type differently.
//! The tie-break is calibrated to AmberTools on the simple heteroaromatics; for
//! antechamber's own answer on any input, use
//! `assign_bcc_bond_types_from_connectivity`.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! A reimplementation of the perception in AmberTools' `antechamber/bondtype.c`
//! (`finalize()` and the `conjatom[]` flags), written by reading that source with
//! the AmberTools developers' permission; see `.claude/notes/notes.md`
//! (2026-07-12) for the licensing posture.
//!
//! # Type 6 — the order-dependence fix of `assign_bcc_bond_types`
//!
//! `bondtype.c`'s type-6 rule (`/*part3*/`) has two defects that make its output
//! depend on the order the bonds appear in the input file:
//!
//! 1. the neighbour scan's `break` is unbraced, so it stops after the *first*
//!    non-partner neighbour — the answer depends on `con[]` order;
//! 2. the mirrored branch (partner stored first) assigns `type = 6`
//!    *unconditionally*, above a loop whose result it then ignores.
//!
//! Measured consequences, against AmberTools25: **nitrate**'s two topologically
//! identical single-bonded O⁻ receive *different* types (6 and 9), splitting their
//! final charges by 0.28 e; and **pyridine-N-oxide**'s N–O bond types as 6 or 9
//! purely according to whether the file wrote that bond as `O-N` or `N-O`.
//!
//! `assign_bcc_bond_types` repairs both: the neighbour scan is **exhaustive**, and
//! the rule is **symmetric in the bond's endpoints** (nitrite stays 6/6,
//! nitromethane 9/9, nitrobenzene 9/9, TMAO 9).
//! `assign_bcc_bond_types_from_connectivity` keeps both defects: its answer already
//! follows the input's order, as antechamber's does, and reproducing antechamber
//! means reproducing them.
//!
//! # The perceived type is a *perceived fact*, and lives in its own key
//!
//! The type is written to [`BCC_BOND_TYPE`] — never to the bond's [`keys::TYPE`](crate::core::keys::TYPE),
//! which belongs to the **caller**: it is where a bond's force-field type *name*
//! (`c3-c3`) or a reader's LAMMPS bond-type id lives, and it is what `to_frame` puts
//! in the `bonds` block's `type` column for every bonded kernel to resolve its
//! parameters by. Two facts, two keys — a
//! component column is typed by its first write and molrs (deliberately) refuses to
//! coerce it, so an `i32` BCC code sitting in `type` makes the molecule unusable for
//! the force field that must later put a `String` name there.
//!
//! This is the same rule the charge models keep (`ff::charge`, ac-004): perception
//! neither reads nor writes `keys::TYPE`, so a molecule's own labels — GAFF names,
//! hostile LAMMPS ids, nothing at all — survive perception **byte-identical** and
//! cannot steer its answer.
