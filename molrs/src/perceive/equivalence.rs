//! Charge equivalencing — the topological-equivalence classes AM1 charges are
//! averaged over before the BCC stage (antechamber's `-eq`).
//!
//! A semi-empirical calculation is done on **one conformer**, so its Mulliken
//! charges are not symmetric: methanol's three methyl hydrogens come out of `sqm`
//! as `(0.053, 0.098, 0.053)` purely because one of them eclipses the O–H. Feeding
//! that straight into a force field yields **conformer-dependent, symmetry-broken**
//! charges — the same molecule, re-embedded, would type differently. Averaging over
//! the topological-equivalence classes removes the artefact (all three become
//! `0.068`, the mean) and is what `antechamber -c bcc` does by default, *before*
//! applying any bond-charge correction.
//!
//! # The algorithm: path scores, **not** automorphism orbits
//!
//! For every atom, enumerate **all simple paths starting at it**, score each path,
//! sort the scores ascending, and compare. Two atoms are equivalent iff they have
//! the **same number of paths** and their sorted score arrays are **elementwise
//! exactly equal** (`f64` equality — there is no tolerance; see
//! [`EquivalenceClasses`]).
//!
//! The score of a path is the Antechamber paper's Eq. (I) — position index `j`
//! (0-based) and atomic number `Z_j` of the atom at that position:
//!
//! ```text
//! score = Σ_j [ (j + 1)·0.11 + Z_j·0.08 ]
//! ```
//!
//! **This is not a graph-automorphism partition, and using one would be wrong.**
//! In exact arithmetic the sum collapses to
//!
//! ```text
//! score = 0.11·L(L+1)/2 + 0.08·(Σ Z along the path)
//! ```
//!
//! so a path enters the score only through its **length** and its **sum of atomic
//! numbers**. Two things follow, and both are load-bearing.
//!
//! **It reads no bond orders and no formal charges.** A Kekulé carboxylate's two
//! oxygens — one `C=O`, one `C–O⁻` — are *the same atom* to this score, so
//! antechamber **merges** them and averages their charges. Any partition that
//! respects bond order or formal charge (Morgan / Weisfeiler-Leman /
//! [`crate::system::graph_hash`], which folds both into its colours) **splits**
//! them. Orbits are therefore a **strictly finer** partition: the path score never
//! splits an orbit — an automorphism maps a path to a path with the same ordered
//! atomic numbers, hence the same score, bit for bit — but it does merge atoms that
//! lie in different orbits. Averaging by orbits leaves acetate's two oxygens at the
//! `sqm` values `-0.595 / -0.597` where antechamber returns `-0.596 / -0.596`: a
//! symmetry-broken carboxylate, and a `1e-3` e divergence from the oracle. A graph
//! hash may be used as a *pre-filter* (same orbit ⇒ same class) but never as the
//! class engine.
//!
//! **It is order-blind only in exact arithmetic.** The score is accumulated
//! left to right along the path in `f64`, and the comparison is exact, so two paths
//! that are mathematically tied (same length, same `Σ Z`, different order — C–N–O
//! and C–O–N) can still land one ULP apart: `H–H–C` sums to `1.2999999999999998`
//! where `C–H–H` sums to `1.3`. The accumulation order is therefore part of the
//! contract, not an implementation detail — the scorer accumulates left to right
//! exactly as `scorepath()` does, so that the equality tested here is the equality
//! antechamber tested. (A *tolerant* comparison would merge such a pair. That is
//! the bug this exactness exists to prevent, and it is pinned by
//! `two_atoms_a_tolerance_would_merge_are_kept_apart`.)
//!
//! # `-eq` levels
//!
//! | Level | antechamber | Meaning |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`EquivalenceLevel::Off`] | `-eq 0` | no equivalencing; every atom is its own class |
//! | [`EquivalenceLevel::Paths`] | `-eq 1` | the path score above — **the default for `-c bcc` / `-c abcg2` / `-c resp`** (and *only* for those; every other charge method defaults to `0`) |
//! | [`EquivalenceLevel::PathsAndGeometry`] | `-eq 2` | the path score with an E/Z coefficient per position, making the partition **strictly finer** than level 1 — never coarser |
//!
//! Because the default is per-charge-method, equivalencing is a **declaration of
//! the charge model**, not a global pipeline stage: see the `needs_equivalencing`
//! flag in the `ChargeModel` trait.
//!
//! [`EquivalenceOptions::max_path_length`] is antechamber's `-pl`: paths longer
//! than the cap are not scored. The default is unlimited, matching `-pl -1`.
//!
//! # Averaging is a separate step
//!
//! Perception ends at the classes. [`average_charges`] applies the class-mean and
//! is called explicitly by the charge model, so that a model which does *not* want
//! equivalencing simply never calls it.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! A reimplementation of the perception in AmberTools' `antechamber/equatom.c`
//! (`scorepath()` / `equatom()`) and the class-mean in `charge.c::bccharge()`,
//! written by reading that source with the AmberTools developers' permission; see
//! `.claude/notes/notes.md` (2026-07-12) for the licensing posture.
