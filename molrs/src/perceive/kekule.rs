/// * **Complete** — on success every aromatic bond has `Single` or `Double`.
/// * **Deterministic** — degenerate assignments are real (benzene has two), so
///   the tie-break is part of the answer. It is keyed on **atom** order alone,
///   so permuting bonds or swapping endpoints cannot move it.
