//! The crate's scalar and array aliases — their one owner.

use ndarray::{Array1, Array2, ArrayView1, ArrayView2};

/// Primary floating-point scalar type — always `f64`.
///
/// Scientific algorithms (potentials, optimizers, coordinate transforms) require
/// double precision.  Lower precision is only used in accelerator hot-paths
/// (GPU kernels) or estimation algorithms, and those are handled locally, not
/// through this project-wide alias.
pub type F = f64;

// ---- Owned arrays ----

/// An owned float vector: a 3-element position, velocity, force or
/// displacement, or any N-element column.

/// An owned float matrix: N×3 (a collection of 3D vectors) or 3×3 (a box
/// matrix, rotation or stress tensor).

/// Primary signed integer scalar type — always `i32`.
pub type I = i32;

/// An index into a block, or a stable entity identifier.
///
/// Named for what it *means*, not for what it *is*. The retired alias `U` was
/// named after a type, so one name carried two unrelated jobs: the width a
/// column stores at, and the type a domain value happens to be. Those pull
/// opposite ways -- a formal charge wants to be small, an identifier wants to
/// be wide -- and one name could not serve both.
///
/// Every column this appears in is identity: `id`, `mol_id`, `type_id`,
/// `res_id`, and the `atomi`/`atomj`/`atomk`/`atoml` relation endpoints.
/// Sixty-four bits because an identifier that wraps is not an identifier:
/// a value past `u32::MAX` used to be truncated rather than refused.
///
/// `U` is also uranium. A text-level rename of the old alias once rewrote
/// `Element::U`, `symbol: "U"` and the GAFF/BCC/ABCG2 `atom_type: "U"` rows
/// along with the type references, and nothing caught it. Rename this through
/// the compiler -- it points only at type positions -- never through a regex.

/// A quaternion is a four-component number `w + x i + y j + z k` whose
/// imaginary units multiply as `i² = j² = k² = ijk = −1`; unit-length
/// quaternions encode 3D rotations without the gimbal problems of angles.
///
/// This is the crate's one quaternion type. Products are Hamilton products
/// (`i ⊗ j = k`); a unit quaternion `q` rotates the vector `v` as `q v q*`,
/// where `v` is written as the quaternion `(0, v)` and
/// `q* = (w, −x, −y, −z)` is the conjugate. The rotation angle `θ` about the
/// unit axis `n` is encoded as `q = (cos θ/2, sin θ/2 · n)`.
