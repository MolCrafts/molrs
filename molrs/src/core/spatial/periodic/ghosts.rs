/// They are integer triples that both count cells, and they are different
/// quantities with different lifetimes:
///
/// * an **image flag** is the history of an owned atom — how many cells it has
///   crossed since the run began, monotone in nothing, owned by the MD state;
/// * a **shift** is which copy the *current* local geometry needs, owned by
///   this type and discarded at the next rebuild.
///
/// They move together at exactly one moment — a wrap — and
/// [`forward_comm`](Self::forward_comm) is where that happens.

///
/// It stores **only ghost columns**. The owned coordinates stay where they
/// live, in the MD state, and arrive by view on every call. A ghost layer that

/// the canonical one, which is precisely the arrangement the wrapped+image
/// design exists to avoid: two copies of one quantity drift apart, and the one
