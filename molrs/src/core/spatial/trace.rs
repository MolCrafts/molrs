//! A trace is an ordered path of 3D points. It has no chemistry: it says
//! *where* consecutive samples of a structure lie, not *what* sits there.
//! Points are in the caller's length unit, Å throughout molrs.
//!
//! `builder::SelfAvoidingWalk` generates one trace per chain; the generator is
//! not the trace.
