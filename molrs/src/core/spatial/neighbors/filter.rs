//! Post-processing filters that prune a [`Neighbors`] table using
//! geometric criteria.
//!
//! A cutoff-based neighbor list answers "which particles are within `r_c`?",
//! which is a question about a number the user picked, not about the structure.
//! The filters here answer "which particles are *actually* nearest neighbors?"
//! — they take an over-generous cutoff list and discard the pairs that a
//! parameter-free geometric criterion says are not part of the first
//! coordination shell (the set of particles directly touching a given one).
//!
//! Two filters are exposed, mirroring `freud.locality`:
//!
//! - [`filter_sann`]: a port of van Meel et al.'s Solid-Angle Nearest-Neighbour
//!   construction
//!   ([source](https://github.com/glotzerlab/freud/blob/main/freud/locality/FilterSANN.cc)).
//!   Each neighbor is imagined to claim a cap of the unit sphere centred on the
//!   query point, whose *solid angle* (area on the unit sphere, measured in
//!   steradians, of which the whole sphere has `4π`) shrinks as the neighbor
//!   gets farther away. The kept set is the smallest number of nearest
//!   neighbors whose caps tile the full `4π`, which fixes both the shell
//!   radius and the coordination number without a user-supplied cutoff — see
//!   [`filter_sann`] for the criterion and its citation.
//! - [`filter_rad`]: Higham–Henchman Relative-Angular-Distance filter
//!   ([source](https://github.com/glotzerlab/freud/blob/main/freud/locality/FilterRAD.cc)).
//!   For each query point we walk neighbors in distance order and drop a
//!   neighbor `j` if there exists an already-accepted closer neighbor `k`
//!   such that the bond `r_ij` lies "behind" `r_ik` (i.e. the angle
//!   `∠(r̂_ik, r̂_ij)` is < some acceptance threshold). The default
//!   threshold is `arccos(½) = π/3 = 60°`, removing redundant second-
//!   shell artifacts that share a half-space with a closer first-shell
//!   bond.
//!
//! Both filters preserve the query-point ordering of pairs but may shrink the
//! list. The output [`Neighbors`] inherits the `mode` and the storage policy of
//! the input.
//!
//! # Both filters require a fully populated input
//!
//! Each filter reads `dist_sq` for its criterion and `disp` to copy surviving
//! pairs into the output, so a table built without either column is rejected
//! with a panic naming the missing column. That is deliberate: a lean table
//! reports an absent column as `None`, and the only alternatives to panicking
//! would be to invent zeros — a zero displacement is a physically meaningful
//! value, so it would be indistinguishable from data — or to return an empty
//! list, which reads downstream as "this particle has no neighbors". Rerun the
//! search with [`NeighborsStorage::FULL`](crate::spatial::neighbors::NeighborsStorage::FULL)
//! instead.

/// covers it. No cutoff or coordination number is supplied by the user.
///
/// # The published criterion
///
/// van Meel et al., *J. Chem. Phys.* **136**, 234107 (2012). Sort the neighbors
/// of a query point by distance, `r_1 ≤ r_2 ≤ … ≤ r_n` (Å). Neighbor `j` claims
/// a spherical cap of solid angle `2π(1 − r_j/R)` for a trial shell radius `R`,
/// and requiring the first `m` caps to tile the whole sphere,
/// `Σ_{j≤m} 2π(1 − r_j/R) = 4π`, gives the shell radius implied by that count:
///
/// ```text
///   R(m) = ( Σ_{j=1..m} r_j ) / (m - 2)
/// ```
///
/// The chosen count is the smallest `m ≥ 3` for which that shell closes before
/// the next neighbor,
///
/// ```text
///   R(m) < r_{m+1}
/// ```
///
/// and the first `m` neighbors are kept. Reading the inequality the other way
/// round: while `R(m) ≥ r_{m+1}` the neighbor at `r_{m+1}` still lies inside the
/// shell that the first `m` imply, so it belongs to the set and `m` must grow.
///
/// # When the shell does not close
///
/// The test for count `m` needs `r_{m+1}`, so with `n` candidates only
/// `m ≤ n - 1` can be evaluated. If no such `m` closes the shell, the criterion
/// is *unconverged* on this candidate set — the answer would need neighbors the
/// input does not contain — and the query point's entire neighbor list is kept.
/// A query point with fewer than 3 neighbors is the same case and is likewise
/// kept whole. Supply a more generous search cutoff if unconverged points
/// matter.
///
/// Distances are Å; the implementation sorts on the stored `dist_sq` (Å²), which
/// is order-equivalent because the square root is monotonic, then takes square
/// roots to evaluate `R(m)` and to compare it against `r_{m+1}`.
///
/// The output inherits the input's `mode` and storage policy, and query points
/// are visited in ascending index order so the result is deterministic.
///
/// # Panics
/// Panics if `nlist` lacks the `dist_sq` or `disp` column. `dist_sq` carries the
/// criterion itself; `disp` is needed to copy surviving pairs into the output
/// table. Neither can be reconstructed from indices, and substituting zeros
