//! Cell-list neighbor search — O(N) with sorted-particle layout and half-shell
//! iteration.
//!
//! A *cell list* divides the simulation box into a grid of cells at least one
//! cutoff wide. A particle can then only have neighbors in its own cell and the
//! 26 cells touching it, which turns the O(N²) all-pairs scan into an O(N) one.
//!
//! Particles are *counting-sorted* by cell index — a linear-time sort that
//! works by tallying how many particles fall in each cell and then scattering
//! them into the resulting offsets — so that all particles in the same cell
//! occupy a contiguous slice of `sorted_idx` / `sorted_pos`. This gives
//! excellent cache locality during the pair search compared to a linked-list
//! layout.
//!
//! Only **occupied cells** are visited during pair search, so sparse systems
//! (few particles, many cells) pay O(N), not O(n_cells).
//!
//! *Half-shell* iteration means each cell only looks at a forward half of its
//! neighboring cells, so every unordered pair is discovered exactly once and
//! the resulting table satisfies `i < j`.
