// Tight 3-coord AABB loops read naturally with index-based access.
#![allow(clippy::needless_range_loop)]

//! Axis-Aligned Bounding-Box tree neighbor search.
//!
//! Mirrors `freud.locality.AABBQuery`
//! ([source](https://github.com/glotzerlab/freud/blob/main/freud/locality/AABBQuery.cc)).
//!
//! An *axis-aligned bounding box* (AABB) is the smallest box with faces
//! parallel to the coordinate axes that contains a set of points; it is cheap
//! to store (two corners) and cheap to test a distance against. A *bounding
//! volume hierarchy* (BVH) is a binary tree of such boxes: each leaf wraps a
//! single point, each internal node owns the union of its two children's boxes.
//! A query descends from the root and prunes any subtree whose box is farther
//! from the query point than the worst candidate found so far, so most of the
//! tree is never visited. Average cost is `O(log N + k)` for `k` neighbors.
//!
//! # PBC handling — MIC-based, no ghost atoms
//!
//! Under periodic boundary conditions (PBC) the box tiles space, so a particle
//! near one face may be close to a particle near the opposite face. The
//! *minimum-image convention* (MIC) is the rule that only the shortest of those
//! separations counts. Periodicity is handled the same way
//! [`LinkCell`](crate::spatial::neighbors::LinkCell) does it: the tree is built
//! **only on the original `N` points**, never on a ghost-expanded set. For each
//! query point we enumerate the lattice-image shifts that could bring a tree
//! point within reach of the query, run one (non-periodic) descent per shift,
//! then pin every hit's displacement to the canonical minimum-image vector
//! returned by [`SimBox::shortest_vector_impl`].
//!
//! Both the indexed points and the query are folded into the primary cell
//! first ([`SimBox::wrap`]), because the image-shift range below is derived
//! from the cell's own geometry and therefore only reaches the images of a
//! point that lies in it. Folding is free of consequence: a minimum-image
//! separation is invariant when either endpoint moves by a lattice vector, so
//! indices and distances are what they would have been. The
//! range on a periodic axis is `n_k = ceil(r / d_k)`, where `d_k` is the
//! **perpendicular plane spacing** [`SimBox::nearest_plane_distance`] and `r`
//! is the reach being probed, giving `2·n_k + 1` shifts on that axis:
//!
//! - `r ≤ d_k` (the typical MD case): `n_k = 1`, so `3` shifts per periodic
//!   axis and `27` tree queries per particle in a fully periodic 3-D box.
//! - `r > d_k`: `n_k ≥ 2`, so `125` or more.
//! - A non-periodic axis contributes only the zero shift, so a fully
//!   free-boundary system needs exactly one tree query per particle.
//!
//! **The range is sized from `d_k`, never from the lattice-vector length
//! `‖a_k‖`.** For a tilted cell `‖a_k‖` over-estimates the usable width
//! (`d_k ≤ ‖a_k‖`, with equality only when the cell is orthogonal along `k`),
//! so dividing the reach by `‖a_k‖` yields *fewer* images than are needed and
//! pairs go missing with nothing raised. `LinkCell` sizes its cells the same
//! way, for the same reason.
//!
//! Duplicate hits across shifts are collapsed to the shortest separation, so a
//! point is reported once regardless of how many images found it.
//!
//! This keeps memory bounded by the original `N` points (no
//! `O(N · n_images)` ghost copies) and aligns the PBC story with the rest
//! of `crate::spatial::neighbors`: every algorithm gets its periodicity from
//! `SimBox`, never from a ghost-expanded point set.
