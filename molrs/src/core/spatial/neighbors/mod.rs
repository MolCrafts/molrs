//! Neighbor-list algorithms for pairwise distance queries.
//!
//! A **neighbor list** is the table of particle pairs that lie closer together
//! than a fixed **cutoff** distance. Almost every pairwise quantity in
//! molecular simulation is computed by walking such a table: short-range
//! forces; the **radial distribution function** (**RDF**), the average number
//! of neighbors found at each separation `r`; **bond-order parameters**, which
//! describe how the *directions* to a particle's neighbors are arranged;
//! clustering. Building the table by testing every pair costs `O(N²)` distance
//! evaluations for `N` particles. The algorithms here bucket space so that the
//! cost falls to `O(N)`.
//!
//! ## Minimum image, sign convention, units
//!
//! Under periodic boundary conditions the simulation box is tiled infinitely
//! through space, so two particles have infinitely many separations — one per
//! periodic copy ("image") of the box. The **minimum-image convention**
//! (**MIC**) keeps only the shortest of them, and that shortest separation is
//! the only one this module ever reports.
//!
//! For a pair `(i, j)` a search produces two quantities:
//!
//! ```text
//! disp    = MIC(r_j - r_i)   displacement vector, pointing from i to j
//! dist_sq = |disp|^2         its squared length, from that same image
//! ```
//!
//! `disp` is **not** normalized — it is not divided by the distance, so its
//! length *is* the pair distance rather than 1. Both quantities come from the
//! single call [`SimBox::shortest_vector_impl`], so they always describe the
//! same periodic image and can never disagree. Lengths carry the unit of the
//! input coordinates, which is Å (ångström) everywhere in molrs; `disp` is
//! therefore in Å and `dist_sq` in Å².
//!
//! ## Searching
//!
//! [`NeighborList`] is the entry point: it owns the cutoff and the **backend**
//! that indexes space, and turns coordinates into pairs. Two backends:
//!
//! - [`LinkCell`] (via [`NeighborList::new`]) — O(N) **cell list**: space is
//!   cut into a grid of cells at least one cutoff wide, so a particle can only
//!   have neighbors in its own cell and the 26 cells touching it. The default
//!   backend and the right choice in production. Indexing runs on one thread;
//!   [`NeighborList::neighbors`] then materializes the table by folding over
//!   occupied cells with rayon (default feature, above a small-system
//!   threshold), which is 2–4× faster at molecular-dynamics sizes and is why
//!   the row order of a materialized table is unspecified.
//!   [`NeighborList::for_each_pair`] stays single-threaded: it hands pairs to
//!   an `FnMut` visitor, which cannot be shared across threads.
//! - [`BruteForce`] (via [`NeighborList::brute_force`]) — O(N²) all-pairs
//!   reference: a test oracle, and adequate for very small systems.
//!
//! Two neighboring questions have their own types. [`NeighborQuery`] runs a
//! **cross-query**, searching one point set against a separate reference set.
//! [`AabbQuery`] is a bounding-volume tree that answers k-nearest-neighbor
//! queries ([`AabbQuery::query_knn`]) — *which `k` points are closest*, a
//! question that has no radius and that a fixed cutoff therefore cannot
//! express. It is the only reason that type exists: cutoff searches belong to
//! [`NeighborList`].
//!
//! ## Streaming a pair versus materializing a table
//!
//! Indexing the coordinates and consuming the pairs are separate steps, and the
//! second step has two shapes. An analysis that touches each pair once and
//! keeps only a reduction — an RDF histogram, an energy sum — **streams**:
//! [`NeighborList::build`] followed by [`NeighborList::for_each_pair`], which
//! hands over one [`NeighborPair`] at a time and allocates nothing. An analysis
//! that walks the same pairs several times, or wants them as columns — a
//! bond-order parameter needs the direction to each neighbor, not just the
//! distance — **materializes** once with [`NeighborList::neighbors`], naming
//! the columns it will actually read (here [`NeighborsStorage::DISP`]).
//! Runnable versions of both are on [`NeighborList`].
//!
//! No self search allocates a [`Neighbors`] table behind the caller's back.
//! [`build`](NeighborList::build), [`build_columns`](NeighborList::build_columns)
//! and [`update`](NeighborList::update) own the spatial index and nothing else —
//! they enumerate no pairs and store no table — and exactly two calls turn
//! freshly searched pairs into one: [`NeighborList::neighbors`], and
//! [`Neighbors::from_pairs`] for a pair stream the caller produced or filtered
//! itself. A cross-query is a different door and answers with a table directly
//! ([`NeighborQuery::query`]).
//!
//! A streamed pair always carries both physical columns. A materialized table
//! keeps only the columns [`NeighborsStorage`] asked for, and reports a column
//! it never stored as `None` — never as a fabricated zero. Two further
//! conventions pin the table down:
//!
//! - A **self-query** searches one point set against itself and is *half-shell*:
//!   each unordered pair appears exactly once, with `i < j`. A **cross-query**
//!   searches a set of query points against a separate reference set; it is
//!   directed and has no ordering constraint.
//! - [`NeighborsStorage::FULL`] means *every column is present*. It does **not**
//!   mean a full-shell (bidirectional) pair list. Column policy and pair
//!   direction are independent choices.
//!
//! ## API at a glance
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let mut nl = NeighborList::new(3.0);       // cell-list backend, cutoff 3 Å
//! nl.build(points.view(), &simbox);          // index only — no pair table
//! nl.build_columns(&xs, &ys, &zs, &simbox);  // ...same, from x/y/z columns
//! nl.update(points.view());                  // re-index, reusing that box
//!
//! nl.for_each_pair(|pair| { /* ... */ });    // stream half-shell self pairs
//! let table = nl.neighbors(NeighborsStorage::FULL);  // ...or materialize them
//!
//! let nq = NeighborQuery::new(&simbox, points.view(), 3.0);
//! let cross = nq.query(query_points.view()); // cross-query, directed
//!
//! table.query_point_indices()   // &[u32]           — i of each pair
//! table.point_indices()         // &[u32]           — j of each pair
//! table.dist_sq()               // Option<&[F]>     — Å², None if not stored
//! table.disp()                  // Option<FNx3View> — Å,  None if not stored
//! ```
//!
//! ## Name mapping from freud
//!
//! The API mirrors [freud-analysis](https://freud.readthedocs.io/) closely
//! enough that freud's documentation transfers, with two deliberate
//! differences: molrs stores the *squared* distance, and molrs makes the
//! physical columns opt-in.
//!
//! | freud | molrs | difference |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `NeighborList.query_point_indices` | [`Neighbors::query_point_indices()`] | — |
//! | `NeighborList.point_indices` | [`Neighbors::point_indices()`] | — |
//! | `NeighborList.distances` (r, Å) | [`Neighbors::dist_sq()`] (r², Å²) | molrs stores the square and never hides a square root inside an accessor; take `.sqrt()` at the call site |
//! | `NeighborList.vectors` | [`Neighbors::disp()`] | same unnormalized MIC vector `r_j - r_i` |
//! | (both always present) | [`NeighborsStorage`] | freud always carries distances and vectors; molrs returns `None` for a column the search was told not to store |
//! | `freud.locality.LinkCell` | [`NeighborList`] (its [`LinkCell`] backend) | — |
//! | `freud.locality.AABBQuery` | [`AabbQuery`] | freud's tree answers both cutoff and k-nearest queries; molrs keeps the cutoff search in [`NeighborList`] and leaves [`AabbQuery`] the k-nearest one |
//! | `freud.locality.FilterSANN` / `FilterRAD` | [`filter_sann`] / [`filter_rad`] | — |
