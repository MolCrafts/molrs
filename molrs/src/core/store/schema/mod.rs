//! The Frame schema — a committed, machine-checked vocabulary for block and
//! column names, and the validator that judges a Frame against it.
//!
//! # A canonical key names a quantity, not a slot
//!
//! This is the axiom the whole design rests on, and it is true only because it
//! is kept true: **if two things need different dtypes under one name, they are
//! two quantities and get two keys.** `type` (String, a force-field label) and
//! `type_id` (UInt, a LAMMPS ordinal) are not an exception to the one-dtype
//! rule — splitting them is the operation that *makes* the rule hold.
//!
//! Every future "but this key needs two dtypes" has one correct answer: then it
//! is two keys. A `DTypeSet` would quietly undo the entire design, because a
//! column's dtype is fixed by its first write and molrs refuses to coerce — so
//! the second writer's value silently fails to land.
//!
//! # Closed vocabulary, open block set
//!
//! A [`ColumnSpec`] binds a key *wherever it appears*, in any block. That is
//! what lets [`Block::insert`](crate::store::block::Block::insert) enforce dtype
//! without knowing which block it is about to live in — dissolving the problem
//! that a standalone `Block` only learns its role when inserted into a `Frame`,
//! by which time a wrong-dtype column would already exist.
//!
//! The *block* set stays open: `MolGraph::to_frame` mints one block per
//! registered relation kind, so a block name with no [`BlockSpec`] is legal and
//! its columns are still checked individually. A column key with no spec is
//! unconstrained — the extension point for perceived facts, per-instance
//! force-field parameters, and format-local columns.
//!
//! # Two layers of enforcement
//!
//! | concern | scope | enforced at |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | dtype, shape | key-global | `Block::insert` / `insert_column` / `rename_column` |
//! | required columns, arity | block-scoped | [`BlockSpec`] via [`Validator`] |
//! | endpoint range, row counts | frame-scoped | [`Validator`] |
