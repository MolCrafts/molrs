/// [`GhostSet`] is a **snapshot** — which copies exist and where they are right
/// now. This keeps one current across a trajectory: it decides when the
/// snapshot has gone stale, rebuilds it, moves it every step, and hands out the
/// pair table and the re-resolved topology that follow. It is the ghost
/// régime's counterpart to
/// [`VerletSkin`](molrs::core::VerletSkin) and answers the same
/// question: has anything moved far enough that what was frozen at the last
/// rebuild is no longer complete?
///
/// # The three operations
///
/// LAMMPS calls this object `Comm`; the name here says what it holds. The
/// operations keep LAMMPS's names, because the point is that a future domain decomposition changes
/// none of them:
///
/// | LAMMPS | here | what it does |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `comm->borders()` | [`GhostSet::borders`] | decide *which* copies exist — a search, at rebuild |
/// | `comm->forward_comm()` | [`GhostSet::forward_comm`] | move them to follow their owners — every step |
/// | `comm->reverse_comm()` | [`GhostSet::reverse_comm`] | sum the forces on copies back onto owners |
///
/// In a single process a forward communication is a translation and a reverse
/// one is a scatter-add. Under MPI they become messages, an owner may live on
/// another rank, and nothing above this layer notices — which is the whole
/// reason to spell them this way now rather than invent a local vocabulary and
