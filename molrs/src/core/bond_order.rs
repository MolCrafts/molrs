/// The chemical class of a bond.

///
/// A bond carries **two** independent properties, and conflating them is the
/// defect this pair of types exists to prevent:
///
/// * `BondOrder` — what *kind* of bond it is. Aromatic is one of the kinds,
///   peer to single / double / triple. A class, never a number.
/// * [`BondNumber`] — the integer bond number a localized Lewis / Kekulé
///   structure gives it. Always an integer.
///
/// An aromatic bond is therefore `BondOrder::Aromatic` **and** a `BondNumber` of
/// `Single` or `Double`: benzene's ring is six `Aromatic` types over an
/// alternating `1,2,1,2,1,2` of numbers. There is no fractional bond number —
/// `1.5` said "aromatic" and "one-and-a-half bonds" at once, so a consumer
/// reading the number could not tell which was meant and drew six double bonds.
///
/// Fractional bond orders from electronic structure (Wiberg, Mayer, resonance
/// averages) are real quantities, but they are *computed properties* with their
/// own keys — never these two.
