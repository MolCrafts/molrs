//! Input requirements for [`Neighbors`] tables — the one place a compute
//! kernel turns "this table cannot answer the question I am asking" into a
//! [`ComputeError::BadShape`]. Two kinds of requirement live here: a *column*
//! the table never stored, and a *query mode* whose pair ordering the kernel
//! cannot consume.
//!
//! A [`Neighbors`] table is the list of particle pairs within a cutoff
//! distance, one row per pair. Besides the two particle indices it may carry
//! two *physical* columns, both taken under the **minimum-image convention**
//! (with periodic boundaries a pair has one separation per periodic copy of the
//! box; only the shortest is ever reported): `dist_sq`, the squared pair
//! distance `|r_j − r_i|²` in Å², and `disp`, the displacement `r_j − r_i`
//! itself in Å, pointing from `i` to `j` and left unnormalized. Which of them
//! a table holds is decided when it is materialized, by
//! [`NeighborsStorage`](molrs::spatial::neighbors::NeighborsStorage).
//!
//! A table reports a column it never stored as `None`, never as a fabricated
//! zero: `disp()` on an indices-only table is `None`, not a view full of
//! `(0, 0, 0)`, because a zero displacement means two coincident particles and
//! would answer confidently and wrongly. Every kernel that needs a column
//! therefore has to reject `None` itself, and each rejection carries the same
//! two facts — which column was missing, and how many pairs went unanswered
//! because of it.
//!
//! The mode requirement is the other half. A table also records *how* it was
//! searched, in its [`QueryMode`]: a **self-query** is half-shell, holding each
//! unordered pair exactly once as `(i, j)` with `i < j`, while a **cross-query**
//! is directed over two point sets and holds a row per (query point, reference
//! point). A kernel that visits each row once and updates *both* of its
//! endpoints — exploiting that the same bond seen from `j` is just the reversed
//! vector — is counting on the half-shell guarantee, and quietly double-counts
//! without it. That is a wrong number rather than a missing one, so it too is
//! refused rather than computed.
//!
//! All three helpers are free functions rather than methods on [`Neighbors`]:
//! the owning type lives in `core`, one layer below this one, and must not learn
//! about [`ComputeError`] to answer a question `core` never asks.
