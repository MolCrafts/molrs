//! The force-field seam: one trait between the integrator and everything that
//! makes a force.
//!
//! An integrator asks exactly one question — *what are the energy, the forces
//! and the virial at this configuration?* — and [`ForceProvider`] is that
//! question. Everything a force evaluation needs on the way to answering it
//! (the potential, the neighbour bookkeeping, the periodic régime, the
//! fold-back of copies onto owners) lives behind the trait, and the integrator
//! sees none of it. That is what makes the engine force-field agnostic: a new
//! way to make a force is a new implementor, not a new enum variant and a new
//! arm in a `match` that every caller must be recompiled against.
//!
//! # It is also the parallelisation boundary
//!
//! One `compute` call is one unit of work an implementation may split across
//! threads however it likes. This is not incidental — it is the reason the
//! trait has the shape it has.
//!
//! The per-pair fold that dominates a step happens *inside*
//! [`Potential::calc_energy_forces_with_pairs`], and `Potential` is a stable
//! interface with dozens of implementors that this module does not get to
//! change. So a parallel fold has to be owned by something above `Potential`
//! and below the integrator. Before this trait there was no such object.
//!
//! Three consequences are load-bearing:
//!
//! * **`&mut self`, and no interior mutability.** A provider is not stateless:
//!   a Verlet skin holds its reference coordinates and its age, a halo holds
//!   its copies and a generation counter, and all of it is bound to *one*
//!   trajectory. Exclusive access for the duration of a call is what lets an
//!   implementation own reusable scratch and mutate it from rayon with no
//!   locks, and split its own data with `par_chunks_mut` with no
//!   synchronisation at all. `&self` plus interior mutability would buy only
//!   concurrent `compute` calls on one shared provider — meaningless here,
//!   because two replicas at different positions cannot share a skin whose
//!   held coordinates name one of them — at the price of a lock every step,
//!   forever. One provider per replica is the right shape, and that needs
//!   `Send`, not `&self`.
//! * **`Send + Sync` on the trait.** A boxed provider must be movable to a
//!   worker thread; just as importantly, the bound *forbids* an implementor
//!   from hiding an `Rc` or a `RefCell` and foreclosing that later.
//! * **An owned [`ForceOutput`] out, borrowing nothing.** No lifetime crosses
//!   the boundary, so a provider may re-partition itself between calls —
//!   rebuild its halo, change its domain decomposition, migrate atoms — with
//!   no caller pinned to its internal layout.
