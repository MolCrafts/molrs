/// The bonded index lists, resolved against the copies that exist now.
///
/// The copies themselves are [`GhostHalo`]'s; this type owns only the bonded
/// indices resolved against them. Which periodic régime an integrator runs is
/// not its question — that is the [`ForceProvider`](crate::md::ForceProvider)'s
/// identity, and it is open rather than enumerated.
///
/// A bonded kernel holds indices, not geometry: it is told *these two atoms are
/// bonded* and takes the plain difference of their coordinates. For a bond that
/// straddles a face those coordinates are a cell apart, so the kernel measures a
/// bond stretched by the width of the box and answers with a force to match.
/// Nothing raises — the number is simply wrong, and it is wrong by orders of
/// magnitude.
///
/// Pointing each term at the copies that make it compact fixes that without any
/// kernel learning that periodic boundaries exist, which is the whole point of
/// the ghost régime.
///
/// This holds **no force field and no frame**. A term is a row of indices, and
/// the parameters that belong with that row live in the kernel, aligned by row;
/// so rebinding a term is rewriting a row, not rebuilding a force field. LAMMPS
/// draws the line in the same place — `Comm` (here [`GhostHalo`]) moves the copies, the `NTopo`
/// classes rebuild the bonded lists against `Domain::closest_image`.
///
/// # Anchoring
///
/// Each term is resolved against **one** atom, not edge by edge:
///
/// * a bond `(i, j)` against `i`;
/// * an angle `(i, j, k)` against the vertex `j`, so both arms are placed
///   relative to the same point;
/// * a dihedral or improper `(i, j, k, l)` against `j`, the atom the others are
///   at most two bonds from.
///
/// Folding each edge against the previous atom instead can pick images that are
/// individually closest and jointly inconsistent — the three atoms of an angle
/// ending in three different cells — and the angle is then measured on a shape
/// that does not exist. An anchor cannot do that: every atom is placed relative
/// to a single point.
///
/// # When it refuses
///
/// A copy can only be chosen from the copies that exist. If the halo does not
/// reach as far as a bonded term does — a short pair cutoff with a long
/// molecule — the nearest available copy is still a cell away, and the term
/// stays stretched. That is reported as [`MdError::Invalid`] rather than
/// returned: a silently mismeasured bond is precisely the failure this type
/// exists to remove, and swapping it for a differently-silent one would be no
/// improvement.
