//! The [`GrowthStrategy`] trait — how a self-avoiding walk places each
//! monomer — and its two built-in implementations.
//!
//! Both are plain structs injected into
//! [`SelfAvoidingWalk`](super::self_avoiding_walk::SelfAvoidingWalk) — there
//! are no factory functions. Overlap is judged by occupancy cells, never by distance:
//! [`FccLattice`] steps onto a global FCC lattice and uses
//! [`OccupancyMode::SameCell`] (distinct sites are already `>= bond_length`
//! apart); [`OffLattice`] grows in continuous space and uses
//! [`OccupancyMode::BlockClear`] with cell edge `excluded_radius`.
