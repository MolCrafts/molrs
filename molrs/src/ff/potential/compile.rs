//! Turning a [`ForceField`]'s declarations into evaluable potentials.
//!
//! [`PotentialCompiler`] reads one force field and has two doors; the
//! difference between them is what carries the non-bonded pair list:
//!
//! * [`PotentialCompiler::compile`] resolves every pair style against the
//!   frame's `pairs` block — a fixed list, finite by construction. Right for
//!   a molecule in free space, and what the geometry optimizer and the
//!   conformer pipeline use.
//! * [`PotentialCompiler::compile_typed`] resolves them against the **atoms**,
//!   so the kernels answer for whatever pairs a neighbour search turns up.
//!   Right for a periodic box, and what MD uses.
//!
//! Both doors price a pair exactly as LAMMPS does: only at `r < cutoff`, the
//! style's own `cutoff` (and between `inner` and `cutoff` through the
//! switch of a style that defines one, `lj/charmm`, `coul/charmm`) — the
//! pairs a list holds beyond it price nothing, 1-4 pairs scaled by
//! `special_bonds` included. A style that states no cutoff has cutoff ∞
//! (the spec's default of `lj/cut`, `coul/cut`, …), so a field read from an
//! engine priced untruncated (OpenMM `NoCutoff`, a prmtop) prices every
//! listed pair. The 1-4 exceptions kernel (a `dihedral charmm` `w`, per-pair
//! overrides) is no pair style and is never truncated, as LAMMPS's
//! `dihedral_style charmm` prices its 1-4 pair at any distance.
//!
//! The direction is one-way: a force field **declares** styles, types and
//! constants, and this module reads them to build kernels. Nothing here is
//! imported back by [`crate::ff::forcefield`].
