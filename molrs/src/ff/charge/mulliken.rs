//! Mulliken populations straight out, with `-eq 0` (no equivalencing, because that is
//! per charge method and Mulliken's default is off).
//!
//! It exists in molrs for two reasons, and only one of them is that users ask for
//! Mulliken charges. The other is that it is the corner of the 2×2 that keeps
//! [`ChargeModel`] honest: a trait that could not carry a model with *no* correction
//! would be a trait that had quietly assumed "QM base charges plus a correction", and
//! the correction stage would have leaked into the seam.
