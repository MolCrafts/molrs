//! [`GasteigerModel`] — Gasteiger/PEOE, aligned with `antechamber -c gas`.
//!
//! The **zero-QM corner** of the charge 2×2: no AM1 charges, no solver, no
//! [`Option`] to unwrap — a molecule goes in and charges come out of the bond graph
//! alone. It reaches the caller through the same [`ChargeModel`] trait as AM1-BCC,
//! with no branch anywhere in the plumbing for the fact that it needs no QM input.
//! That is what says [`ChargeModel`] did not quietly assume "QM base charges plus a
//! correction".
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! Partial equalization of orbital electronegativity (Gasteiger–Marsili). Each atom's
//! electronegativity is a quadratic in its own charge,
//!
//! ```text
//! chi_i(q) = a_i + b_i * q_i + c_i * q_i^2
//! ```
//!
//! and along every bond, charge flows from the lower-χ atom (which therefore goes
//! positive) to the higher-χ one, normalised by the **donor's** cation
//! electronegativity χ⁺ and damped by one further factor of a half per sweep:
//!
//! ```text
//! dq = (chi_high - chi_low) / chi_plus[donor] * 0.5^(sweep + 1)
//! ```
//!
//! The transfer is antisymmetric — one atom gains exactly what the other loses — so
//! the total charge never moves off the seeds it started from.
//!
//! # Three things it is not
//!
//! * **Not a fixed six iterations.** antechamber runs a damped convergence loop
//!   ([`CONVERGENCE`] 1e-5, [`MAX_SWEEPS`] 500), and every one of the 37 oracle
//!   molecules needs more than six sweeps — methane 7, methylammonium 15. Truncating
//!   at six leaves methylammonium's nitrogen 0.0131 e short, 131× the 1e-4 gate.
//! * **`chi_plus` is a DIVISOR, not a quartic coefficient.** `GASPARM.DAT`'s columns
//!   run `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `formal_charge`, and reading `d` as `+ d*q^3` is the one
//!   catastrophic misreading of the table. It is χ⁺ = χ(q = 1): for every heavy row
//!   `d == a + b + c` exactly (`c3`: 7.98 + 9.18 + 1.88 = 19.04 = d). **Hydrogen is
//!   the exception** — H⁺ is a bare proton, so its polynomial χ⁺ is meaningless and
//!   the table substitutes a fixed 20.02 eV where `a + b + c` would give 12.85. The
//!   model reads the column; it never rebuilds it from `a + b + c`.
//! * **Not renormalized to the formal net charge.** `-c gas` ignores `-nc`: what is
//!   conserved is the sum of the SEED charges (`GASPARM.DAT`'s `formal_charge`
//!   column), which is not always the net charge. `ATOMTYPE_GAS.DEF` has no aromatic
//!   N⁺ type, so imidazolium — a +1 cation — is typed all-neutral, seeded at 0, and
//!   antechamber's own `-c gas` charges for it sum to 0. Renormalizing it to +1 would
//!   conserve *something* perfectly while sitting a whole electron from the oracle.
//!
//! # It is Jacobi
//!
//! The whole χ array is built from the previous sweep's charges **before** any
//! transfer is applied; the transfers accumulate into the running charges, and the
//! snapshot χ is read from is only rolled forward at the end of the sweep. Feeding a
//! half-updated charge back into χ mid-sweep (Gauss–Seidel) changes the convergence
//! trajectory and the answer.
