//! The currency of the interpolation seam: one bonded term, named by its atoms.

//! [`BondedTerm`] used to live inside the OPLS typifier, which made it read as an
//! OPLS thing ("the two endpoint `opls_NNN` types"). It never was: it is the query
//! type of the generic [`ParameterInterpolator`](super::ParameterInterpolator)
//! seam, and GAFF speaks it too. A term is its **atom-type names**, in the order
//! the force field writes them; which force field named them is not this type's
//! business.
