//! Form codecs: the exact maps between the styles of one physics
//! (`ff-ir-01` P3, on the protocol of `ff-ir-02` §9).
//!
//! A **form family** is a set of styles whose energies are one function
//! space parametrised differently — the torsions (Fourier series in φ), the
//! harmonic bonds and angles, the Lennard-Jones pairs. Each member registers a
//! [`FormCodec`] beside its kernel
//! ([`Registry::register_form`](crate::ff::style_registry::Registry::register_form)):
//! its family, and two exact maps between its own parameters and the family's
//! **canonical** style's:
//!
//! * `embed` — this style → canonical (exact: the same energy, constant
//!   included), refusing a row the canonical style cannot hold;
//! * `project` — canonical → this style, exact on its image, refusing with a
//!   [`FormRefusal`] that names the condition otherwise (a Fourier series with
//!   `bₙ ≠ 0` has no RB form);
//! * optionally `seed` — canonical → the nearest member of this style's
//!   image by a rule of thumb, where a fit starts.
//!
//! The codecs are vocabulary; converting a force field with them is
//! [`crate::ff::form_conversion`]'s.
//!
//! The built-in families ([`builtin_forms`]):
//! | family | canonical | members |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `torsion` | `dihedral periodic` | `dihedral` `charmm` (w = 0), `opls`, `multi/harmonic`, `nharmonic`, `harmonic`, `class2`, `rb`; `improper` `cvff`, `periodic` |
//! | `bond` | `bond harmonic` | `bond class2` (k3 = k4 = 0) |
//! | `angle` | `angle harmonic` | `angle class2` (k3 = k4 = 0), `angle charmm` (k_ub = 0) |
//! | `lj` | `pair lj/cut` | `pair lj/class2` (= lj/cut n = 9, m = 6, σ' = (2/3)^⅓ σ) |
//!
//! No codec, by design: `improper harmonic` and `bond`/`pair` `morse` are no
//! member of any family's function space (fit them with `fit_form`);
//! `pair lj/charmm` always switches between `inner < cutoff` (its kernel
//! refuses `inner = cutoff`), so it is never exactly `lj/cut`.
