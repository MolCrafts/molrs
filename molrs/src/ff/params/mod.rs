//! Every force-field parameter table molrs ships, as typed, compile-time Rust
//! data — **one place, one form**.
//!
//! molrs parses **no** parameter text at runtime. The upstream `.DAT` / `.DEF`
//! tables are transcribed into the `const`s in the sibling modules here by
//! `scripts/gen_param_tables.py`, which reads them from `$AMBERHOME`; [`mmff`]
//! is ported from RDKit's `Params.cpp` and merged with what MMFF's retired XML
//! carried; [`oplsaa`] is the retired `oplsaa.xml`. The committed `.rs` is the
//! single in-repo source of truth; a malformed table is therefore a **compile**
//! error, not a runtime one, and the tables can be grepped, diffed and stepped
//! through like any other code.
//!
//! This module owns the row types of the tables it emits, and the sibling
//! modules own only data. (The RDKit port keeps its own row structs next to the
//! rows they describe — it is a transcription of one upstream file and is moved
//! verbatim, not re-shaped.) They are all ordinary source files, not build
//! artefacts: how a table *arrived* belongs in its header doc, never in its name.
//!
//! # The ATD / WILDATOM grammar
//!
//! All seven `ATOMTYPE_*.DEF` files share one grammar. An [`AtdRule`] is a
//! conjunction of constraints on a candidate atom — atomic number, degree,
//! attached-hydrogen count, an [`AtomProp`] expression, and a neighbourhood
//! [`AtomPattern`] tree. Rules are tried **in file order** and the first match
//! wins.
//!
//! The environment and property mini-languages are **pre-parsed** into the
//! static AST below, so the typifier walks a tree instead of re-parsing a
//! string for every atom and every candidate rule.
//!
//! # The `parm` force fields
//!
//! [`GAFF`] and [`GAFF2`] are the same idea applied to AMBER's `parm` format:
//! `gaff.dat` and `gaff2.dat` become [`ParmTable`]s of MASS / BOND / ANGLE /
//! DIHE / IMPROPER / NONBON rows. Values are kept in the **upstream's own units
//! and conventions** — degrees, and AMBER's un-halved force constants — because
//! the table is a transcription of the file, not a force field: converting to
//! molrs's radians-and-half-k kernel convention is the job of the reader that
//! populates a [`ForceField`](crate::ff::forcefield::ForceField) from it (see
//! [`crate::ff::forcefield::gaff`]).
