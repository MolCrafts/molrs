//! GROMACS topology reader: force-field directives, and whole systems.
//!
//! Two products from one parser:
//!
//! - [`ForceFieldReader::read`] / [`read_str`](ForceFieldReader::read_str)
//!   read the force-field **directives** of a topology (`forcefield.itp` with
//!   its includes, or a `.top`'s directive sections) into a [`ForceField`];
//! - [`GromacsTopForcefieldReader::read_system`] / [`read_system_str`](GromacsTopForcefieldReader::read_system_str)
//!   read a whole `.top` — directives **and** molecules — into the
//!   [`ForceField`] and a typed [`Frame`] (see [`system`](self#whole-systems)).
//!
//! The file speaks nm, kJ/mol, degrees and e; the force field is the molrs
//! force-field IR, whose definitions follow LAMMPS (`real`: Å, kcal/mol,
//! degrees for angle-valued parameters, e; LAMMPS's factors — no hidden ½).
//! Every conversion happens here, at the boundary.
//!
//! # Directives read
//!
//! - **`[ defaults ]`** `nbfunc comb-rule gen-pairs fudgeLJ fudgeQQ`. Requires
//!   nbfunc 1 (Lennard-Jones). comb-rule 2 (σᵢⱼ = ½(σᵢ+σⱼ), εᵢⱼ = √(εᵢεⱼ))
//!   is `mixing` `arithmetic`, comb-rule 3 (σᵢⱼ = √(σᵢσⱼ), εᵢⱼ = √(εᵢεⱼ))
//!   `geometric`, declared on the Lennard-Jones pair style. The special-bond
//!   weights are `lj [0, 0, fudgeLJ]` and `coul [0, 0, fudgeQQ]` — GROMACS
//!   excludes 1-2 and 1-3 pairs and scales the generated 1-4 pairs. With
//!   gen-pairs `no` GROMACS generates no 1-4 Lennard-Jones parameters (every
//!   1-4 pair takes a `[ pairtypes ]` row or its own parameters, at full
//!   weight) and the LJ weight is `1`; fudgeLJ is then unused, as in GROMACS.
//! - **`[ atomtypes ]`** `name [bond_type] [at.num] mass charge ptype V W`.
//!   Columns resolve from the right: the last five are `mass charge ptype V W`
//!   (`ptype` one of `A S V D B`); the one to three leading tokens are `name`,
//!   an optional `bond_type` and an optional integer `at.num`. Each row defines
//!   - an `atom/full` type with `mass` (amu), `charge` (e), `atomic_number`
//!     (when present) and string `ptype` and `class` (= `bond_type`, when
//!     present);
//!   - a self row of the Lennard-Jones pair style with `sigma` = V·10 (Å) and
//!     `epsilon` = W/4.184 (kcal/mol) — V/W are σ/ε under comb-rules 2 and 3,
//!     so `[ atomtypes ]` requires `[ defaults ]`;
//!   - the Coulomb pair style, with `coulomb` = [`GROMACS_COULOMB`] (GROMACS's
//!     own constant) and `dielectric` = 1 (vacuum).
//! - **`[ nonbond_params ]`** `i j func V W`, func 1: an explicit cross row of
//!   the Lennard-Jones style between the atom types `i` and `j` (σ, ε as for
//!   `[ atomtypes ]`), which the kernels use in place of the comb-rule. The row
//!   is stored with its two types in byte order and named
//!   [`TypeName::pair`](molrs::core::TypeName::pair) of them, so
//!   `j i` restating `i j` is the same row and a different one is an error.
//! - **`[ pairtypes ]`** `i j func V W`, func 1: the Lennard-Jones parameters
//!   of the 1-4 pairs of atom types `i`, `j` (see [1-4 pairs](#1-4-pairs)).
//! - **`[ bondtypes ]` / `[ angletypes ]` / `[ dihedraltypes ]`**
//!   `labels… funct params…`, keyed by the row's labels (GROMACS bond types,
//!   the `class` of the atom types). GROMACS `X` becomes the empty-endpoint
//!   wildcard, so `X CT CT X` is the type `-CT-CT-`. The 2-name dihedraltypes
//!   form `a b funct …` is GROMACS's shorthand for `a X X b` (funct 2) and
//!   `X a b X` (every other funct).
//! - **`[ cmaptypes ]`** `a b c d e 1 N N v₁ … v_{N²}` (lines joined at a
//!   trailing `\`): a `cmap/charmm` type on the five labels, `grid` the N×N
//!   map in kcal/mol. GROMACS lists the map φ-major from −180° with step
//!   360°/N (`cmap_setup_grid_index`), which is the IR's layout, so value
//!   `i·N + j` is `grid[i][j]` unchanged.
//!
//! | Directive, funct | GROMACS form | molrs style | Conversion |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | bondtypes 1 | ½k_b(r−b₀)² | `bond/harmonic` {`r0`, `k`} | r0 = 10·b₀ Å; k = k_b/(2·418.4) kcal/mol/Å² |
//! | bondtypes 3 | D[1−e^{−β(r−b₀)}]² | `bond/morse` {`d0`, `alpha`, `r0`} | d0 = D/4.184; alpha = β/10 Å⁻¹; r0 = 10·b₀ |
//! | angletypes 1 | ½k_θ(θ−θ₀)² | `angle/harmonic` {`theta0`, `k`} | θ₀ as written; k = k_θ/(2·4.184) kcal/mol/rad² |
//! | angletypes 5 | ½k_θ(θ−θ₀)² + ½k_UB(r₁₃−r₁₃⁰)² | `angle/charmm` {`k`, `theta0`, `k_ub`, `r_ub`} | k = k_θ/(2·4.184); k_ub = k_UB/(2·418.4); r_ub = 10·r₁₃⁰ |
//! | dihedraltypes 1 | k[1+cos(nφ−φ_s)] | `dihedral/periodic` {`k`, `periodicity`, `phase`} | k/4.184; φ_s as written |
//! | dihedraltypes 9 | Σ of the consecutive rows with equal labels | `dihedral/periodic` {`k<m>`, `periodicity<m>`, `phase<m>`} (one row: as funct 1) | each term as funct 1, in file order |
//! | dihedraltypes 2 | ½k_ξ(ξ−ξ₀)², ξ signed | `improper/harmonic` {`k`, `chi0`} | k = k_ξ/(2·4.184); ξ₀ ∈ {0°, 180°} |
//! | dihedraltypes 3 | Σₙ₌₀⁵ Cₙ cosⁿ(φ−180°) | `dihedral/multi/harmonic` {`a1`..`a5`}, `dihedral/nharmonic` {`a1`..`a6`} when C₅ ≠ 0 | aₙ₊₁ = (−1)ⁿ Cₙ/4.184, constant included |
//! | dihedraltypes 4 | k[1+cos(nφ−φ_s)] | `improper/periodic` {`k`, `periodicity`, `phase`} | as funct 1 |
//! | dihedraltypes 5 | ½[C₁(1+cos φ) + C₂(1−cos 2φ) + C₃(1+cos 3φ) + C₄(1−cos 4φ)] | `dihedral/opls` {`k1`..`k4`} | kₙ = Cₙ/4.184 |
//! | cmaptypes 1 | CHARMM bicubic map | `cmap/charmm` {`grid`} | grid/4.184 |
//!
//! Every conversion is exact: RB is the polynomial `nharmonic` /
//! `multi/harmonic` (the torsion algebra, `ff::forcefield::torsion`), so no
//! RB row is refused for its C₅ or its ΣCₙ. ½k_ξ(ξ−ξ₀)² is signed and
//! molrs's `improper/harmonic` is `K(χ−χ₀)²` with χ = |φ|: they agree for ξ₀ =
//! 0° and ξ₀ = 180° and for no other ξ₀, which is refused.
//!
//! Improper rows keep their atom order: GROMACS prices the dihedral of the
//! listed order, as molrs does (an AMBER port lists the centre third, a CHARMM
//! port first).
//!
//! Rows repeated across sections or includes follow the conflict rule of
//! [`Style::def_type`](crate::ff::forcefield::Style::def_type): equal
//! parameters are one type, different ones an error. When two styles of one
//! category would name a type alike (funct 9 and funct 3 rows on the same four
//! labels), both are qualified with their function code (`-CT-CT-@3`).
//!
//! # 1-4 pairs
//!
//! GROMACS prices a 1-4 pair (a `[ pairs ]` row) at the `[ pairtypes ]` row of
//! its two atom types, at full weight, or — gen-pairs `yes` and no such row —
//! at the comb-rule (or `[ nonbond_params ]`) parameters scaled by fudgeLJ;
//! its Coulomb is scaled by fudgeQQ. The IR states the same thing with
//! LAMMPS's `lj/charmm` parameters: when a `[ pairtypes ]` row prices a pair
//! differently from that generated value, the Lennard-Jones style is
//! `lj/charmm` (with `coul/charmm`), declared `one_four = "epsilon14"`, and
//! each type pair's `epsilon14` / `sigma14` — a self row's, an explicit cross
//! row's, or the mix of the two self rows' — is the 1-4 pair's parameters
//! divided by the 1-4 weight (ε₁₄ = ε_pairtype / fudgeLJ; σ₁₄ = σ_pairtype),
//! so `special_bonds` × LJ(ε₁₄, σ₁₄) is GROMACS's 1-4 energy for every type
//! pair. Cross rows are written exactly where the mix of the self rows would
//! differ (to 10⁻¹² relative), with the pair's regular parameters beside
//! them. Without such a `[ pairtypes ]` row the styles are `lj/cut` and
//! `coul/cut`, as for AMBER and OPLS-AA. gen-pairs `yes` with fudgeLJ 0 and a
//! `[ pairtypes ]` row is refused: one weight cannot price the pairtype pairs
//! at 1 and the generated ones at 0.
//!
//! `lj/charmm` switches between `inner` and `cutoff`, run settings GROMACS
//! keeps in the `.mdp`: the reader declares neither, and a caller sets both
//! before compiling.
//!
//! # Whole systems
//!
//! [`GromacsTopForcefieldReader::read_system`] reads the molecule sections too and
//! returns the force field with a typed [`Frame`] (0-based atom indices):
//!
//! | Section | Frame |
//! |---|---|
//! | `[ atoms ]` | `atoms`: `type`, `charge`, `mass` (the atom type's when the row omits them), `name`, `res_id`, `res_name`, `mol_id` (1-based molecule instance) |
//! | `[ bonds ]` funct 1, 3 | `bonds` |
//! | `[ angles ]` funct 1, 5 | `angles` |
//! | `[ dihedrals ]` funct 1, 9, 3, 5 | `dihedrals` |
//! | `[ dihedrals ]` funct 2, 4 | `impropers` |
//! | `[ cmap ]` funct 1 | `cmaps` |
//! | `[ constraints ]` funct 1, 2; `[ settles ]` | `constraints` (`r0`, Å) |
//! | nrexcl, `[ exclusions ]` | `exclusions` |
//! | `[ pairs ]`, nrexcl | `pairs`: every pair GROMACS prices, `is_14` on the `[ pairs ]` rows |
//! | `[ molecules ]` | the molecule types repeated in order |
//!
//! Each relation row's `type` is the force-field type GROMACS's own lookup
//! picks: bonds, angles, Fourier dihedrals and cmaps match their atoms' bond
//! types exactly (cmaps forward only, the others either way), the other
//! dihedrals take the first row with the most non-wildcard matches, either
//! way — the funct-9 terms of that row come with it. A row with parameters
//! of its own defines a type of its own, named by its labels qualified
//! `@gmx_<n>`. `#define` macros are expanded in every row, so an OPLS-AA
//! `improper_Z_N_X_Y` row is a funct-1 row with those parameters.
//!
//! A `[ pairs ]` row with parameters is priced by them, at full Lennard-Jones
//! weight and fudgeQQ Coulomb (funct 1), or at its own fudgeQQ and charges
//! (funct 2): the per-pair override columns (`epsilon`, `sigma`, `lj_scale`,
//! `coul_scale`, `charge_product`) of `pairs`. A row without parameters is
//! priced by the force field (`special_bonds` and `epsilon14` above); with
//! gen-pairs `no` it needs a `[ pairtypes ]` row, as in GROMACS.
//!
//! `pairs` lists every pair GROMACS prices: per molecule, the pairs beyond
//! `nrexcl` chemical bonds (bonds funct 1 and 3, constraints funct 1) and not
//! in `[ exclusions ]`, and the `[ pairs ]` rows (which must be excluded, else
//! GROMACS would price them twice); and every pair of two molecules, up to
//! `MAX_ATOMS_FOR_A_FULL_PAIR_LIST` atoms (above it the list is the
//! intramolecular one, and a neighbour list — `compile_typed` — finds the
//! others). LAMMPS derives its exclusions and its
//! 1-4 list from the bonds alone; a topology whose `[ pairs ]` and exclusions
//! are those of `nrexcl` 3 (every `pdb2gmx` topology) is priced the same by
//! both.
//!
//! # Refusals
//!
//! Anything this reader does not model is an `Err` naming it, never a silent
//! drop:
//!
//! - function codes outside the tables above (bond 2, 4, 5–10; angle 2, 3, 4,
//!   6, 8, 10; dihedral 8, 10, 11; pair funct other than 1 and 2; constraint
//!   other than 1 and 2), dihedral 2 with ξ₀ ∉ {0°, 180°}, a non-integer
//!   multiplicity, a row with the wrong parameter count, a cmap grid that is
//!   not square, a row on the atoms of an earlier row of its function-code
//!   table (either way round) with other parameters (GROMACS warns and
//!   applies it over the first);
//! - comb-rule 1 (V/W are C6/C12), nbfunc 2 (Buckingham); a `[ nonbond_params ]`
//!   or `[ pairtypes ]` row with a func other than 1 or on an undefined atom
//!   type;
//! - `[ constrainttypes ]` when reading a force field (no force-field category
//!   holds a constraint; [`read_system`](GromacsTopForcefieldReader::read_system)
//!   reads it for `[ constraints ]`), `[ implicit_genborn_params ]`, and any
//!   unknown section;
//! - every molecule section when reading a force field (read the topology with
//!   `read_system`); in a system, the sections with no IR form: virtual sites,
//!   restraints, polarization, `[ pairs_nb ]`, `[ intermolecular_interactions ]`;
//! - in a system: B-state (free-energy) columns, an atom type or molecule type
//!   that is not defined, a row no type matches, atoms numbered out of order.
//!
//! A section the caller names with
//! [`GromacsTopForcefieldReader::with_skipped_directive`] is read past instead, rows
//! and all.
//!
//! # Preprocessor
//!
//! - `#include "file"` is followed when [`GromacsTopForcefieldReader::with_include`]
//!   is `true` (and ignored otherwise). It resolves relative to the including
//!   file, then against each [`with_include_dir`](GromacsTopForcefieldReader::with_include_dir)
//!   directory (GROMACS's share/top for `#include "charmm27.ff/forcefield.itp"`);
//!   a file already read is not read again.
//! - `#define NAME [body]` and `#undef NAME` maintain a define set; a row's
//!   whitespace-separated token that names a define is replaced by its body.
//! - `#ifdef` / `#ifndef` / `#else` / `#endif` select lines against that set,
//!   and nest.
//! - A line ending in `\` continues on the next.
//! - Text before the first `[ section ]` is not read (GROMACS ignores it too;
//!   charmm27's `forcefield.itp` opens with a banner).
//! - `#if`, `#elif` and any other directive are an `Err`.
