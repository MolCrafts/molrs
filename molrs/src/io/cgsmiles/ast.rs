//! `CGsmiles` coarse-graph intermediate representation.
//!
//! One `CGsmiles` string describes a molecule at one or more *resolutions*:
//! the coarse level names beads (`{[#PEO][#PEO]}`), and later levels resolve
//! each bead into a fragment. These types are the parsed form of a coarse
//! level — named nodes, typed edges, and a byte [`Span`] back into the input
//! for every one of them.
//!
//! They live here, next to their only consumer, rather than in `chem/`: that
//! module's vocabulary is what SMILES and SMARTS *share*, and a coarse-grained
//! bead is neither. The one type this module borrows from there is
//! [`BondingDescriptor`], which the fragment dialect and the coarse graph
//! genuinely do share.
//!
//! Every type here is a value produced by
//! [`CgSmilesIr::parse`](crate::io::cgsmiles::CgSmilesIr::parse): the fields are public
//! to read, there is no public constructor, and there is no supported
//! mutation — the same shape as
//! [`SmilesIr`](crate::io::smiles::SmilesIr).

/// A parsed `CGsmiles` string: the blocks that were written, and the levels
/// they denote.
///
/// A *resolution level* is one view of the same molecule: the coarse level
/// names beads, and a finer level names what each bead is made of. A
/// `CGsmiles` string carries one base block and any number of **fragment
/// blocks** after it, each mapping the names used one level up to the bodies
/// that replace them.
///
/// # Authority
///
/// `fragments[k]` is the **authority** for a fragment's shape: it is what the
/// string wrote. `levels[k + 1]` is the **expansion** that table denotes — one
/// disjoint copy of a body per node of `levels[k]` — a derived representation
/// the reader produces once. Editing one would not update the other, which is
/// why there is no public constructor and no supported mutation: a value of
/// this type is read, not built.
///
/// # Alignment invariant
///
/// A base-only string has no fragment table and one level:
/// `fragments.is_empty() && levels.len() == 1`. Otherwise `fragments.len()` is
/// the number of fragment blocks that were written and
/// `levels.len() == fragments.len()` — one fewer level than one might expect,
/// because the **last** block is atomistic and builds no coarse level. That
/// asymmetry is intentional: levels are graphs of beads, and atoms are not
/// [`CgNode`]s. The last table's bodies stay
/// [`FragmentBody::Smiles`] values with their bonding
/// descriptors intact.
///
/// # A value the reader returns is finished
///
/// Every `CgSmilesIr` returned by
/// [`CgSmilesIr::parse`](crate::io::cgsmiles::CgSmilesIr::parse) is **fully
/// instantiated, validated and resolved**: every name used at a level has a
/// definition, every intermediate table has been expanded into the next level,
/// every bonding descriptor a written edge needs has been paired and recorded
/// in [`pairs`](CgSmilesIr::pairs), and every refusal this version makes
/// (starting with the squash operator `[!]`) has already been raised. The
/// reader hands out no half-resolved state. The fields are `pub`, so the type
/// does not enforce this for a hand-built value — the reader is the only
