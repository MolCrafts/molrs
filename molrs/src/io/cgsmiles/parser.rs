//! Recursive-descent parser for a `CGsmiles` string: block structure, coarse
//! graphs and fragment tables.
//!
//! Three layers sit in this file. [`CgParser::split_blocks`] cuts the string
//! into its `{…}` blocks lexically — `.` separates blocks and means something
//! else entirely inside one. [`CgParser::parse_fragment_block`] reads a block
//! after the first as a table of `#NAME=body` entries and dispatches each body
//! **by position**: the last block's bodies are atomistic and go to
//! `parse_fragment_smiles`, every earlier one's is a coarse graph and goes to
//! [`CgParser::parse_body`]. And the token loop below reads one coarse graph,
//! whether it came from a block or from a body.
//!
//! A graph is always read by a *fresh* parser seeked to its absolute offset in
//! the whole input, never by a scanner over a substring: that is what keeps
//! `|n`'s replay, a body-level diagnostic and a re-based atomistic diagnostic
//! all pointing at bytes of the string the caller passed in.
//!
//! The grammar of one graph is small enough to read in one token loop:
//! [`CgParser::step`] reads the next token and folds it into the graph being
//! built, and every construct — a node, a bonding descriptor, a bond symbol, a
//! branch, a ring marker, a `|n` repeat — is one arm of it.
//!
//! Two decisions are worth stating before the code. The bond symbol is *not*
//! a different token for each position the notation allows it in: it is read
//! once and remembered as `pending`, and whatever comes next spends it — a
//! node as the chain bond (which is also how the branch bonds of
//! `{[#A](=[#B])[#C]}` and `{[#A]([#B])=[#C]}` arrive, since a node follows
//! the symbol in both), a ring marker as the ring bond, a descriptor bracket
//! as the order of the bond its pairing will create, and `|` as the bond that
//! chains the repeated copies. And the `|n` repeat re-reads the unit's bytes
//! by rewinding this same scanner over the full input
//! ([`Scanner::seek`](crate::line_notation::scanner::Scanner::seek)), so a
//! diagnostic raised inside a copy still points at a position in the string
//! the caller passed in.
//!
//! Comments below cite grammar rules as `R2.4`, `R2.20` and so on. Those are
//! the numbered rules of `.claude/specs/cgsmiles-01b-graph.md` and
//! `.claude/specs/cgsmiles-01c-fragments.md` § Domain basis,
//! each of which records where it came from — the `CGsmiles` documentation,
//! the reference implementation at a named commit, or an inference marked as
//! such. `F1.9` and the like name those specs' worked fixtures. `01d` is the
//! next spec in the same chain (`.claude/specs/cgsmiles-01d-resolve.md`, which
//! pairs the bonding descriptors this file only carries, and expands a level
//! into atoms); naming it marks work this file deliberately leaves undone.
