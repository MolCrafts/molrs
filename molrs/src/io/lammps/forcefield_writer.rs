///   id order. A label the [`ForceField`] does not define is an error naming the
///   block and the label; a `ForceField` type no label uses is not written
///   (assembly retyping legitimately leaves stale types behind).
/// - **Whole-FF serialization** ([`crate::io::gromacs`], [`crate::io::openmm_xml`]) writes
///   every type the `ForceField` holds, as a force-field file, and takes no
///   labels.
///
/// The data-file writer and this writer are composed by the caller; neither
/// calls the other.
///
/// # Label matching
///
/// - `atoms` labels select pair coefficients: the self pair named by each label
///   (missing → error), plus explicit cross pairs whose two atom types are both
///   labels.
/// - `bonds`, `angles`, `dihedrals` and `impropers` labels match a
///   `ForceField` type name exactly: a label is the name of the type it
///   stands for, and `h1-c3` does not find a type named `c3-h1`.
/// - A block whose types carry no labels (pure-integer types) is matched by
///   its ids, `"1"`, `"2"`, ….
/// - A style is written only when it holds a used type; an unsupported style
///   is an error only then. Type-less pair styles (`coul/cut`) apply to every
///   atom and are always in play.
///
/// # Coefficients through the styles' codecs
///
/// Inverse of [`LammpsForcefieldReader`](crate::io::lammps::LammpsForcefieldReader). The
/// force-field IR follows the LAMMPS standard — every style's expression,

/// # Pair style layout
///
/// The reader splits a combined `lj/cut/coul/*` kernel into `lj/cut` +
