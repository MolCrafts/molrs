//! Intermediate representation (IR) types for SMILES and SMARTS notation.
//!
//! [`SmilesIR`] is a pure syntax tree that captures the notation faithfully
//! without committing to atomistic or coarse-grained semantics.
//! SMARTS is modelled as a superset: [`AtomSpec::Query`] and [`BondQuery`]
//! extend the SMILES-only variants without breaking existing consumers. The
//! fragment dialect is a second extension: [`AtomNode::descriptors`] carries
//! the `CGsmiles` / `BigSMILES` bonding descriptors and is empty for the two
//! plain dialects.
//!
//! This module lives under `chem/` because the AST is the shared vocabulary of
//! all three dialects. Language-specific processing — parsing entry points,
//! validation and graph conversion — lives in the sibling `smiles/` module.
//! SMARTS *matching* ([`crate::perceive::smarts`]) compiles its queries from
//! this AST: there is one SMARTS parser, the one in this module.
