//! Descriptor resolution: pairing the bonding descriptors of one `CGsmiles`
//! level with the descriptors of the entities its edges join.
//!
//! A parsed level knows that two beads are bonded; it does not know *through
//! which written descriptor*. This step answers that once, at parse time: for
//! every edge, in parse order, and for each of the bonds its multiplicity
//! stands for, the first free compatible pair of ports wins, both ports are
//! consumed and the match is recorded on the IR as a [`ResolvedPair`]. An edge
//! that no free pair can form is refused
//! ([`SmilesErrorKind::CgUnmatchableEdge`]) rather than dropped; ports still
//! free when a level is done are dropped rather than forced, and the freed
//! valence of an atomistic port is a later hydrogen-repletion step's business.
//!
//! Two descriptors are compatible when, after flipping `<` against `>` on one
//! of them, the whole descriptor agrees: the same pairing role, the same
//! label, and the same **effective** bond order — no symbol written is the
//! same order as an explicit `-`, so `[$]` pairs `-[$]` while `=[$]` pairs
//! neither.
//!
//! **Edges are paired in parse order** — the order the notation formed them,
//! with a ring-closure edge where its closing marker was read — while the
//! `CGsmiles` reference implementation (the Python package
//! `gruenewald-lab/CGsmiles`, cited in full below) iterates its graph
//! library's adjacency order instead: for
//! `{[#A]1[#B][#C]1}` that is (0,1), (1,2), (0,2) here against (0,1), (0,2),
//! (1,2) there. Because pairing is greedy and consumes ports as it goes, a
//! ring-bearing string can therefore consume different ports than the
//! reference does. What is contracted is the graph the expansion builds, not
//! which port of a bead a given edge took.
//!
//! Resolving an intermediate level also creates work for the next one: each
//! pair it forms joins two child nodes, and that bond is appended to the level
//! below as a [`Derived`](EdgeOrigin::Derived) edge — after every written
//! edge, so indices already handed out stay stable — before that level is
//! resolved in turn.
//!
//! Rules R4.6, R4.9, R4.11–R4.17, R4.19 and R4.20 of
//! `.claude/specs/cgsmiles-01d-resolve.md` § Domain basis. The compatibility
//! rule is the `BigSMILES` one — Lin, T.-S. et al., *BigSMILES: A
//! Structurally-Based Line Notation for Describing Macromolecules*, ACS Cent.
//! Sci. **5**, 1523–1531 (2019), DOI 10.1021/acscentsci.9b00476 — as the
//! `CGsmiles` reference implementation applies it
//! (github.com/gruenewald-lab/CGsmiles at commit `910c9ee`,
//! `resolve.py:14-59`), and the bond-kind precedence is the Daylight Theory
//! Manual's, *SMILES* § 3.
