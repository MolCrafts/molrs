//! `CGsmiles` coarse-graph notation: parser and intermediate representation.
//!
//! `CGsmiles` writes a molecule at a *coarse-grained* resolution: a block
//! `{…}` of named **beads** — single nodes each standing for a whole fragment
//! of the molecule — joined like atoms in SMILES. `{[#PEO][#PEO][#PEO]}` is a
//! three-bead trimer of poly(ethylene oxide); each `#NAME` is a fragment name
//! that a later block resolves. A whole string is a `.`-separated sequence of
//! blocks: block 0 is the coarsest graph, and every block after it is a
//! *fragment table* naming the bodies of the nodes written one level up. This
//! module reads all of them into a [`CGSmilesIR`], and expands each
//! intermediate table into the level it denotes.
//!
//! **Reading builds no atoms.** What the reader produces is the coarse levels,
//! their fragment tables and the descriptor pairing over them — no `Frame`, no
//! `MolGraph`. Turning the lowest level into real atoms and bonds is a second
//! step the caller asks for by name, [`CGSmilesIR::to_atomistic`]. Beside it
//! stands [`CGSmilesIR::templates`], which builds the *pieces* rather than
//! the whole: one instance-free
//! ported [`Atomistic`](crate::core::Atomistic) **template** per definition of the
//! last fragment table, each open valence made explicit as a capping hydrogen
//! carrying a port. Expansion is the molecule the string states; a template is
//! what a builder places, many times, without re-reading the string. The third
//! conversion, [`CGSmilesIR::to_coarsegrain`], needs no fragment table at all:
//! it reads the coarsest level, `levels[0]`, as a
//! [`CoarseGrain`](crate::core::CoarseGrain) bead graph — one
//! bead per node, one CG bond per edge, no coordinates.
//!
//! # What the block grammar says
//!
//! * A node is `[#NAME]`, optionally annotated `[#NAME;q=-0.5;kind=ether]`.
//!   Two `[#A]` occurrences are two distinct nodes sharing a name.
//! * Adjacency is a bond. The symbols `-`, `=`, `#`, `$` write the
//!   multiplicities 1..=4, and the default is 1. One symbol serves every
//!   position it may be written in: between two nodes, before a ring marker,
//!   around a branch, before `|` — where it becomes the bond that joins each
//!   repeated copy to the previous one — and before a bonding-descriptor
//!   bracket, where it becomes the order the descriptor's later pairing will
//!   take.
//! * `( … )` branches and nests, attaching to the node written before `(`.
//! * A bare digit, or `%` and the whole digit run that follows it (`%1` is
//!   marker 1, `%123` is marker 123, up to 65535), opens a ring marker that
//!   its second occurrence closes; a marker number is reusable once closed.
//!   The closure's bond order may be written at *either* end — an order
//!   belongs to the bond, not to the end it was written at — and two
//!   **differing** explicit symbols are a conflict
//!   ([`SmilesErrorKind::RingBondConflict`]), not an override.
//! * `|n` repeats the preceding unit `n` times in total, chaining the copies.
//!   After `)` the unit is the whole branch **including its anchor**, so
//!   `{[#A]([#B][#C])|2}` is six nodes, not four.
//! * Node annotations bind positionally: slot 1 is the `#NAME`, slot 2 is `q`
//!   (partial charge), slot 3 is `w` (mapping weight). `[#A;0.5]` therefore
//!   means `[#A;q=0.5]`, and a fourth positional field has no slot to take.
//!   Keys the table does not reserve are kept verbatim — except `x`, the
//!   dialect's chirality key, which is refused (below).
//!
//! Units: `charge` is a **partial charge in elementary charge units `e`**, not
//! a formal charge (`.claude/notes/science.md`); `w` is dimensionless; a bond
//! order is a dimensionless multiplicity 1..=4.
//!
//! # What the fragment blocks say
//!
//! A block after the first is a table, `{#NAME=body,#NAME=body}`: entries are
//! separated by `,` and each splits on its **first** `=`, so a body may carry
//! further ones (`#A=C=C` is a double bond). A name must be defined exactly
//! once in its table and every name used one level up must be defined —
//! [`SmilesErrorKind::CgDuplicateFragment`] and
//! [`SmilesErrorKind::CgUndefinedFragment`] otherwise. The converse is not an
//! error: a table may define more than the level above it uses, which is how a
//! shared library block is written.
//!
//! **The wildcard bead `[#*]` is an ordinary fragment name**, not a
//! match-anything pattern: `*` is simply a name character, so `{[#*][#A]}` is
//! a base-only string over the two names `*` and `A`. Name coverage treats it
//! like any other name — `{[#*]}.{#A=CC}` is
//! [`SmilesErrorKind::CgUndefinedFragment`] carrying `"*"`, because the table
//! defines `A` and no table defines `*`.
//!
//! **The last block is atomistic, by position.** Its bodies are OpenSMILES
//! fragment bodies, kept as [`FragmentBody::Smiles`] with their bonding
//! descriptors; every earlier block's bodies are coarse graphs over the next
//! level's `[#X]` nodes, kept as [`FragmentBody::Graph`]. Nothing in the
//! notation marks which is which — the reference implementation passes its
//! reader a `last_all_atom` flag instead — so dispatch here is positional and
//! flag-free. The **limitation** that follows is stated rather than worked
//! around: a string whose deepest resolution is meant to stay coarse-grained
//! cannot be written, and a coarse body in the last block is
//! [`SmilesErrorKind::CgLastBlockNotAtomistic`].
//!
//! **Levels and tables do not line up one-to-one, on purpose.** Each
//! intermediate table is expanded into the next level — one disjoint copy of a
//! body per node that names it, with [`CGNode::parent`] pointing back — while
//! the last table builds no level at all, because a level is a graph of beads
//! and atoms are not [`CGNode`]s. A base-only string therefore has no table
//! and one level; otherwise `levels.len() == fragments.len()`.
//!
//! # Refusals of valid notation (choices of this first implementation)
//!
//! None of these is a property of the notation — each is this implementation
//! declining to model something, loudly rather than silently. ("A later
//! `cgsmiles-*` link" names a follow-up specification in
//! `.claude/specs/`, the chain of documents this parser was built from.)
//!
//! * **Bond order 0**, written `.` (`{[#A].[#B]}`): a virtual edge between
//!   virtual particles. Refused with [`SmilesErrorKind::CgInvalidBondOrder`]
//!   until a later `cgsmiles-*` link models virtual particles, which needs a
//!   level-side representation rather than a fifth [`CGBondOrder`] variant.
//! * **A non-default mapping weight `w`**, keyword (`[#A;w=2]`) or positional
//!   (`[#A;0;0.5]`): refused with
//!   [`SmilesErrorKind::CgUnsupportedAnnotation`] until a later `cgsmiles-*`
//!   link models mapping weights, together with the pending
//!   schema-vocabulary spec that decides where a weight column lives. The
//!   default `w = 1` parses, and is dropped rather than retained.
//! * **A chirality annotation `x`** (`[#A;x=S]`): refused with the same
//!   [`SmilesErrorKind::CgUnsupportedAnnotation`], because a coarse-grained
//!   bead has no stereocentre for molrs to place and silently keeping the key
//!   as free text would claim otherwise.
//! * **The squash operator `[!]`** (`{[#A][!]}`), the one bonding descriptor
//!   that puts a single atom in two beads at once rather than marking a site
//!   where two fragments may later be joined: refused with
//!   [`SmilesErrorKind::CgSquashUnsupported`] wherever it is written — base
//!   graph, coarse fragment body or atomistic fragment body, all three caught
//!   by the one structural rule. No specification in the chain lifts it yet;
//!   parsing it as an ordinary descriptor would keep the glyph and lose the
//!   sharing it stands for.
//!
//! # Invariants and caveats
//!
//! * **Alignment.** `fragments[k]` is the authority for a fragment's shape and
//!   `levels[k + 1]` is the expansion it denotes. A base-only string has
//!   `fragments.is_empty() && levels.len() == 1`; otherwise
//!   `levels.len() == fragments.len()`, one level short of the number of
//!   tables because the last one is atomistic.
//! * **Descriptor pairing is finished before the IR is handed out.**
//!   Instantiation copies a body's own edges and nothing else; the step that
//!   pairs the bonding descriptors *between* two copies runs straight after
//!   it, and records every match in [`CGSmilesIR::pairs`]. **Why pairing is
//!   parse-stage while SMILES ring closure is build-stage:** a ring closure is
//!   intra-body and only means anything once atoms exist, so it belongs to the
//!   builder, whereas descriptor pairs are needed at coarse levels that never
//!   become atoms at all — a reader of the coarse graph reads `pairs` without
//!   expanding anything — so they have to be finished before the value is
//!   returned.
//! * **Pairing follows parse order, and only the graph is contracted.** Edges
//!   are paired in the order the notation formed them, while the reference
//!   implementation follows its graph library's adjacency order: for
//!   `{[#A]1[#B][#C]1}` that is (0,1), (1,2), (0,2) here against (0,1), (0,2),
//!   (1,2) there. A ring-bearing string can therefore consume different ports
//!   and, once expanded, number its atoms differently. What is contracted is
//!   the **connectivity**: the expansion
//!   ([`CGSmilesIR::to_atomistic`]) is isomorphic to the reference's and to
//!   what the molpy builder builds from the same string as an unlabelled
//!   graph; atom indices are not part of that contract, and neither are bond
//!   classes. The reference sets order 1.5 whenever both endpoint atoms are
//!   aromatic, over a written symbol as well, so its biphenyl `-[$]` bond is
//!   1.5 where molrs writes [`BondKind::Single`](crate::io::smiles::BondKind)
//!   and its `=`/`=` pair is 1.5 where molrs writes `Double`; molrs follows
//!   the Daylight Theory Manual, *SMILES* § 3.2.2, where a written symbol is
//!   the bond's order.
//! * **Ports left free are dropped.** A descriptor no edge needed creates
//!   neither a bond nor an atom; filling the valence it leaves open at the
//!   atomistic level is a later hydrogen-repletion step the caller composes.
//! * **Replayed spans are shared.** `|n` re-reads the unit's bytes by
//!   rewinding the one scanner over the full input, so every copy carries the
//!   *template's* [`Span`](crate::io::smiles::Span): spans within a level are
//!   neither disjoint nor monotonic, and a diagnostic raised inside a copy
//!   points at the template's text.
//! * **Descriptors are cloned per copy, ring markers are not replayable.** A
//!   bonding descriptor is a pairing *class*, consumed one occurrence at a
//!   time, so three copies of `[$1]` are three ports of class `$1`. A ring
//!   marker is a one-shot identity, so opening or closing one inside a
//!   repeated unit is [`SmilesErrorKind::CgRepeatOnRingMarker`].
//! * **Edges are in parse order**, the ring-closure edge emitted where its
//!   closing marker is read. The reference implementation iterates its graph
//!   library's adjacency order, so a ring-bearing string indexes edges
//!   differently there.
//!
//! # Three reference behaviours this reader does not mirror
//!
//! Each is a place where `CGsmiles @ 910c9ee` accepts or drops something
//! silently and molrs refuses it instead, so the difference is recorded rather
//! than discovered:
//!
//! * two definitions of one name — the reference keeps the first and drops the
//!   rest; this reader raises [`SmilesErrorKind::CgDuplicateFragment`];
//! * an empty block `{}` — the reference's block regular expression skips it;
//!   this reader raises [`SmilesErrorKind::CgEmptyBlock`], in any position;
//! * `|n` written as a body's last token (`{#B1=[#PEO]|4}`) — the reference
//!   crashes there; this reader replays it like any other repeat.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Three resolutions: beads of blocks, blocks of beads, beads of atoms. Level
//! 1 is the expansion of the first table — two `[#PEO]` copies per `[#B1]`
//! node, each remembering the node it came from — while the last table's
//! bodies stay atomistic.
//!
//! ```
//! use molrs::io::smiles::{FragmentBody, parse_cgsmiles};
//!
//! let ir = parse_cgsmiles(
//!     "{[#B1][#B2][#B1]}.\
//!      {#B1=[>][#PEO][#PEO][<],#B2=[>][#PE][#PE][<]}.\
//!      {#PEO=[>]COC[<],#PE=[>]CC[<]}",

/// Parse a `CGsmiles` string — every resolution block it writes — into its

///
/// `CGsmiles` is a line notation that writes a molecule at a *coarse-grained*

/// 1..=4 (the default is 1), `( … )` branches, a bare digit or `%` and a digit

/// preceding unit `n` times in total, and `;`-separated annotations decorate a
/// node — `[#A;q=-0.5]`, or positionally `[#A;-0.5]`, since annotation slot 2
/// is `q`.
///
/// Blocks are separated by `.`, and every block after the first is a

///
/// The **last** block is atomistic by position — the notation marks it

///
/// # Valid notation this parser refuses

///
/// A body of the last block is parsed by

///
/// A body that parses and then fails to **build** gets that same treatment:
