//! Expansion of the lowest `CGsmiles` level into one [`Atomistic`] graph.
//!
//! Each node of that level is one instance of its fragment definition: the
//! body is converted once per definition, and each run of consecutive nodes
//! naming the same definition is stamped into one accumulating graph by a
//! single [`Atomistic::replicate`], every copy carrying its node's index as
//! `frag_id`.
//! Every [`ResolvedPair`](crate::io::smiles::ResolvedPair) of the level then
//! becomes one real bond, given the class the pairing resolved rather than the
//! single bond [`Atomistic::add_bond`] defaults to.
//!
//! What comes out is **topology only** — the heavy atoms the bodies wrote, the
//! bonds they and the pairing imply, and the properties the notation declared.
//! A line notation states no geometry, so no atom carries a position; no
//! hydrogen is added and no perception is run. Those are steps a caller
//! composes.
//!
//! Only the lowest level becomes atoms. The pairs of an intermediate level
//! stay on the IR for a reader that wants the coarse graph itself.
