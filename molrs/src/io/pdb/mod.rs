//! PDB, the Protein Data Bank coordinate format (PDB 3.3,

//! The doors are functions of [`crate::io`]: [`read_pdb`](crate::io::read_pdb),
//! [`read_pdb_trajectory`](crate::io::read_pdb_trajectory) (every `MODEL`),
//! [`read_pdb_bytes`](crate::io::read_pdb_bytes),
//! [`write_pdb`](crate::io::write_pdb) and
//! [`write_pdb_trajectory`](crate::io::write_pdb_trajectory). This module holds
//! the format's classes: [`PdbReader`] / [`PdbWriter`] over any byte stream,
//! and [`PdbIndexBuilder`], the chunked frame indexer.
