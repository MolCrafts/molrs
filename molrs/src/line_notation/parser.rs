//! Recursive-descent parser for the three line-notation dialects: SMILES,
//! SMARTS, and the SMILES fragment body.
//!
//! The parser directly mirrors the LL(1) grammar:
//!
//! ```text
//! molecule     → component ('.' component)*
//! component    → chain
//! chain        → atom chain_tail*
//! chain_tail   → branch | ring_closure | bonded_atom
//! branch       → '(' bond? chain ')'
//! ring_closure → bond? rnum
//! bonded_atom  → bond? atom
//! atom         → bracket_atom | organic_atom | '*'
//! bracket_atom → '[' isotope? symbol chirality? hcount? charge? class? ']'
//! bond         → '-' | '=' | '#' | '$' | '/' | '\' | ':' | '~' | '@'
//! rnum         → digit | '%' digit digit
//! ```
//!
//! The fragment dialect adds one production and two placements for it,
//! accepted only by [`parse_fragment_smiles`]:
//!
//! ```text
//! descriptor   → '[' ('$' | '<' | '>' | '!') label? ']'
//! label        → alnum*
//! leading_run  → descriptor+ bond?     // before the chain's first atom
//! anchored_run → bond? descriptor+     // anywhere after it
//! ```
//!
//! A descriptor is not a node: it binds to the atom written before it (or, at
//! the start of a chain, to that chain's head), so it is consumed at the
//! `atom` call sites and folded into [`AtomNode::descriptors`] rather than
//! appearing in the tree on its own. The optional `bond` in each run is the
//! order that descriptor annotates, and it takes the only side available: in
//! a leading run there is no atom yet to write it in front of, so it follows
//! the bracket (`[$]=CCC`); everywhere else it precedes it (`CC=[$]`), and a
//! bond written after the bracket is an ordinary bond to the next atom.

///
/// # Where a descriptor lands
///
/// A descriptor is not a node of the chain; it binds to a node and is stored
/// in [`AtomNode::descriptors`](crate::io::smiles::AtomNode). The atom it
/// binds to is the one written immediately before it, or — when it is written
/// before any atom of its chain — that chain's head atom, so `[$]COC[$]`
/// carries a `$` on the first carbon and another on the last. A `(` is not a
/// node either, so a descriptor just inside a branch binds to the atom before
/// the `(`: `N([>])C` puts `>` on the nitrogen. Several descriptors may sit on
/// one atom and are kept in written order: `[>][$1]COC[<]` gives the first
/// carbon the list `[>, $1]`. No valence check is made.
///
/// # Where the bond order is read from
///
/// The order a descriptor annotates is written next to its bracket, not inside
/// it, and which side counts depends on whether any atom of the chain has been
/// parsed yet. Before the first atom there is nothing to the left, so a bond
/// symbol *after* the bracket is the descriptor's order: `[$]=CCC` is a
/// double-bond-annotated `$` on the first carbon over an otherwise single
/// C-C-C chain. Once an atom exists the symbol before the bracket is the
/// order and a symbol after it is an ordinary bond to the next atom, so
/// `CC=[$]` is a double-annotated `$` while `C[$]=CC` is an unannotated `$` on
/// the first carbon plus a double C=C bond. Of a run of brackets only the one
/// the symbol is written against takes the order, so `[>][$1]=CCC` annotates
/// `$1` and `CC=[$][>]` annotates `$`; the rest of the run carries none. The
/// leading form is strictly the less expressive of the two — it cannot spell
/// `C[$]=CC` — which is why
/// [`write_fragment_smiles`](crate::line_notation::writer::write_fragment_smiles) emits
/// the trailing form only.
