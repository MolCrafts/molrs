"""CGsmiles notation — ``molrs::io::cgsmiles``.

CGsmiles writes a molecule at one or more *coarse-grained* resolutions — a
resolution at which one particle, a *bead*, stands in for a whole group of
atoms. Its door is a function of :mod:`molrs.io`:
:func:`~molrs.io.read_cgsmiles_str` reads the molecule a string states, its
lowest level expanded into atoms.

:class:`CgSmilesIr` is the parsed string: one :class:`CgGraph` per resolution
level plus the fragment tables that resolve them out; ``to_atomistic()``
expands the lowest level into atoms (topology only — atoms, bonds and the
per-atom ``frag_id`` saying which bead each atom came from), ``templates()``
builds one ported template per fragment, and ``to_coarsegrain()`` reads the
coarsest level as a bead graph. A line notation states no geometry, so
coordinates, hydrogens and perception remain separate steps. The records it
hands out — :class:`CgGraph`, :class:`CgNode`, :class:`CgEdge`,
:class:`CgFragmentDef`, :class:`ResolvedPair` and :class:`PairEnd` — are
read-only views over the parsed value, so no fact of the notation has to be
re-parsed, decoded or unpacked from a bare tuple position on the Python side.

The enums the notation does not spell out keep lowercase variant names:
``ResolvedPair.kind`` is a bond kind (``"single"``, ``"aromatic"``, …) and
``PairEnd.end`` is ``"sub"`` or ``"body"``. A refusal is a
:class:`molrs.io.smiles.SmilesError` with ``notation == "cgsmiles"``.

There is no ``CgSmilesReader``, deliberately: a parser of one string into
an IR is not a path-backed cursor, and the one-shot door onto a notation is
a ``molrs.io.read_<fmt>_str`` function, not a class.
