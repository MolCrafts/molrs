"""Pure numeric primitives — ``molrs::op``.

Weighted rigid superposition (Horn quaternion with a scale-free eigen-gap
test), weighted centroids, and NeRF placement of a point from internal
coordinates. Points cross as ``(k, 3)`` float64 arrays and
rotations as ``(3, 3)`` row-major matrices. All computation is in Rust; this
module is a thin re-export of ``_native.op``.
