"""Typifier base, its ``TypeAssignment``, and the built-in force-field typifiers.

A typifier implements one hook, ``assign(graph) -> TypeAssignment``: it reads a graph and
returns the annotations to write, positional against the graph's nodes and
against each relation kind's own rows (``graph.links.exact_bucket(cls)``). The
base :class:`Typifier` owns the rest. ``typify(mol)`` copies ``mol``, calls
``assign`` on the copy, stamps the match onto the copy and defines its types in
the output force field — ``forcefield()``, of which ``typify`` is the only
writer. A subclass must not define ``typify``.

The built-in typifiers accept and return ``Atomistic``. :class:`ElementTypifier`
labels by element symbol alone and defines no force field.

:func:`assign_cmaps` builds a typed frame's ``cmaps`` block from its
dihedrals, against a force field's CMAP types.
