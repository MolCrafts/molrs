"""Freshness guard for ``python/molrs/_native.pyi`` at class-name level.

``_native.pyi`` has claimed this test since it was written; this is it. It
compares, in **both** directions, the top-level ``class`` names the stub
declares against the public classes the native module actually exports, so a
new pyclass that nobody declared — and a declaration whose class has been
deleted or moved to a ``.py`` module — both fail here rather than rotting.

Two facts decide how the comparison is set up:

* **The gate is the native wheel.** ``tox -e py`` builds the default-feature
  wheel with maturin and force-installs it before running pytest
  (``pyproject.toml:96-107``), so ``molrs._native`` here is that wheel's
  extension module and the class set is the default-feature surface.
* **The stub is read from the source tree**, not from ``molrs.__file__``.
  The same tox block asserts the imported package resolves under
  ``site-packages``: the install is non-editable, so resolving the stub next
  to the imported package would check a *copy* rather than the file a
  contributor edits.

The only exemption is structural, never a name allowlist: a ``_native``
attribute that is a **module** (``_native.md``) may be declared in the stub as a
class, because a stub has no other way to describe a submodule.
