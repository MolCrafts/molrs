//! `CGsmiles` (`molrs::io::cgsmiles`): the coarse-graph intermediate
//! representation, its classes under `molrs.io.cgsmiles`, and the
//! `molrs.io.read_cgsmiles_str` door.
//!
//! *Coarse-graining* is standing one particle — a **bead** — in for a whole
//! group of atoms, so a polymer can be written and simulated without naming
//! every atom in it. `CGsmiles` is a *line notation* (a molecule written as
//! one string, the way SMILES writes an atomistic one) that states a molecule
//! at one or more such **resolutions**: the coarsest level names beads, each
//! later block says what the names one level up stand for, and the last block
//! is ordinary atomistic SMILES. Reference: Grünewald et al., *J. Chem. Inf.
//! Model.* (2025), DOI 10.1021/acs.jcim.5c00064.
//!
//! [`PyCgSmilesIr`] is the single front door: `molrs.io.cgsmiles.CgSmilesIr(text)`
//! parses, and every other class here is a read-only view over one record of
//! the value it returns — a resolution level, a node, an edge, a fragment
//! definition, a resolved descriptor pair, one end of such a pair, or a
//! bonding descriptor. They are produced by `CgSmilesIr` and nowhere else, so
//! none of them has a constructor on the Python side.
//!
//! There is deliberately **no** `CgSmilesReader`: in this binding "Reader"
//! means a lazy, path-backed trajectory cursor (`molrs.io.pdb.PdbReader`, …),
//! and a text-in / IR-out parser is not that object; the one-shot door is
//! `molrs.io.read_cgsmiles_str`.
//!
//! # Values at the boundary
//!
//! An enum that *is* a count crosses as the count: [`PyCgEdge::multiplicity`]
//! is `CgBondOrder` read through
//! [`CgBondOrder::multiplicity`](molrs::io::cgsmiles::CgBondOrder::multiplicity),
//! a dimensionless `1..=4`. Every other enum crosses as a *name*, never as
//! the small integer `core` stores such a value as (`BondOrder::code`: 0
//! unknown, 1 single, 2 double, 3 triple, 4 aromatic). The storage codes are
//! a column encoding, not a boundary encoding, and they are not injective
//! over the enums crossing here: `BondKind::{Up, Down, Any, Ring}` all store
//! as single and `Quadruple` as double, so a caller could not read the
//! written notation back out of a number.
//!
//! Which name depends on whether the notation itself already spells the
//! variant. A descriptor kind does: `$`, `<`, `>`, `!` is what a user types
//! and what a stored port's `port_kind` prop holds
//! ([`PortKind::as_str`](molrs::core::PortKind::as_str)), so
//! [`PyBondingDescriptor::kind`] crosses as that same glyph — one spelling
//! for the notation, the column and the boundary, with no third vocabulary to
//! translate between them. The enums the notation does *not* spell out cross
//! as the lowercase spelling of their Rust variant instead:
//! [`PyBondingDescriptor::order`] and [`PyResolvedPair::kind`] are bond-kind
//! names (`"single"`, `"aromatic"`, …) and [`PyPairEnd::end`] is `"sub"` or
//! `"body"`. Lowercase names are what the parent module `io` already uses at
//! this boundary — `build_smiles_emit_options` reads exactly such spellings
//! back into Rust enums.
//!
//! [`bond_kind_name`] lists every variant explicitly, and
//! [`descriptor_kind_name`] delegates to
//! [`DescriptorKind::as_str`](molrs::io::smiles::DescriptorKind::as_str),
//! which does: no input can panic across the seam, and a new variant upstream
//! is a compile error rather than a runtime one.

/// Intermediate representation of a parsed `CGsmiles` string.

/// An *intermediate representation* is what the string says, in structured

/// or more *resolutions*: the coarse level names beads (``{[#PEO][#PEO]}``),
/// and every block after the first is a table of the fragment bodies the
/// level above named. Constructing this class parses, validates, expands and
/// resolves the whole string; the value it returns is finished, and is read
/// rather than built. Turning it into atoms is a separate call,
/// :meth:`to_atomistic`.
///
/// Attributes
/// ----------
/// levels : list of CgGraph
///     Resolution levels, coarsest first. Level 0 is the base block that was
///     written; every later level is the expansion of the table above it.
/// fragments : list of dict of (str, CgFragmentDef)
///     Fragment tables, coarsest first, each keyed by the name written after
///     ``#`` and in name order. ``fragments[k]`` resolves the names of
///     ``levels[k]``.
/// pairs : list of list of ResolvedPair
///     Resolved descriptor pairs, parallel to :attr:`levels`, in resolution
///     order. A level with nothing to pair against carries an empty list.
///
/// Notes
/// -----
/// ``len(levels) == len(fragments)`` whenever any fragment table was written
/// — one level fewer than blocks, because the last block is atomistic and a
/// level is a graph of beads, not of atoms. A base-only string is the other
/// case: ``fragments == []`` and ``len(levels) == 1``.
///
/// Examples
/// --------
/// >>> ir = molrs.io.cgsmiles.CgSmilesIr("{[#OH][#PEO]|3[#OH]}.{#OH=[$]O,#PEO=[$]COC[$]}")
